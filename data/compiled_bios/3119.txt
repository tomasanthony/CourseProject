Prior to SFU, I was an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Before WUSTL, I was a software engineer at Google. Before Google, I was a post-doctoral research associate at University of Washington . I worked with Prof. Seitz and Prof. Curless at University of Washington , and Rick Szeliski at Facebook (was at Microsoft Research). I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Ponce at Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2008.
