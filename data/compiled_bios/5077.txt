I'm a professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Media Arts and Technology Program (an interdisciplinary program positioned at the convergence of arts, media, and technology). My research interests are in computer vision and human-computer interaction, largely concerned with using computer vision as an input modality. That means using cameras (and other sensors) to perceive relevant information about people and the world - e.g., identity, facial expression, body movement, gestures, 3D scene structure - and then using this information to improve the interface between humans and computers.In recent years, many of the applications have been in augmented reality, and mostly focused on real-time mobile computing environments.
