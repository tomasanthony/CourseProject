 Home News Members Current Alumni Research Papers Theses SW & DATA Classes Welcome to Scal able E nergy-Efficient Computing Laboratory (SCALE) Dear Visitor: Welcome to our group's website! Our research projects focus on advancing the scalability of computing chips and systems by making them more energy efficient. Current projects include: (1) emerging computing paradigms in molecular informatics and approximate computing; (2) energy-efficient processing for embedded deep learning, biometric security, computer vision and augmented reality systems; (3) thermal/power sensing, modeling and management for mobile SoCs and cloud servers; and (4) machine learning enabled silicon compilation. We have useful material available for download including lecture notes , publications , software tools and research data . We are looking forward to hearing from you.
