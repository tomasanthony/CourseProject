"Seek what you know as the highest. It does not matter whether it is going to happen or not - living with a vision itself is a very elevating process"... "Self-Discipline: The ability to do what you know you should do, whether you feel like it or not". "Character training through intelligent self-discipline makes human energy socially oriented". (If the human energy is socially oriented, most of the problems in the world will be automatically solved!) "If you are poor, work. If you are rich, work. If you are burdened with un-seemingly unfair responsibilities, work. If disappointments come, work. If sorrow overwhelms you and loved ones seem not true, work. If health is threatened, work. When dreams are shattered and hope seems dead, work. Work as if your life is in peril. Its really is. No matter what ails you,work. Work faithfully. Work in faith. Work is the great remedy available for both mental and physical afflictions. All,without exception, perform work. There is no way of renouncing work altogether (always there is another work!)".
