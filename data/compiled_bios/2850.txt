He is a member of the Programming Languages Group in Waterloo, and was previously a member of the Secure Software Systems group at Purdue University. His research focuses on the intersection of virtual machines and dynamic languages, and in particular JavaScript, the programming language of the web. He was a major contributor to Oracle's TruffleJS implementation of JavaScript, as well as the author of JavaScript research tools JSBench and TracingSafari. In addition, he has worked on gradually-typed programming languages, and making the gradual typing model amenable to highly-dynamic languages such as JavaScript. His prior research focused on dynamic software metrics, so as to have a verifiable basis for future expansion.
