 Top Information Contact Social Twitter LinkedIn Hello, I am Tarik Moataz Postdoctoral Researcher at Brown University Information Learn more about me Overview Publications Patents Talks Services About me bio I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Computer Science at Brown University working with Seny Kamara . I received a French-American joint Ph.D. degree from IMT Atlantique and Colorado State University . My main research area is applied cryptography and, especially, its intersection with algorithms and data structures. My research focuses on designing provably-secure protocols that are efficient and ready for real-world deployment. Inspired by real world problems, I enjoy working in the area of encrypted search and aim to provide a better understanding of the balance between security and efficiency. One of my best examples is Clusion ! An open source library implementing advanced encrypted search schemes. I am the associate director of the Encrypted Systems Lab and am a member of the CAPS research group. Here are my DBLP and Google Scholar links.
