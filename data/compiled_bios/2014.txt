He received the BSc degree in computer science from The University of Hong Kong in 1989, the PhD degree in computer science from Princeton University in 1995. From 1989-1991, he was a teaching and research assistant at Princeton University. From 1992-1995, he was a research fellow at Stanford University. Professor Kao has published extensively in various international journals, conference proceedings, and books. (DBLP records) He has also served as program committee member for many international computer conferences and as reviewer for many journals. Professor Kao's research interests include database management systems, data mining, real-time systems, and information retrieval systems.
