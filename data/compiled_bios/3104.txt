Game theory, traditionally a subfield of economics, uses mathematical models to study interactions among multiple independent strategic decision makers. I use game theory to study mult-agent interactions that arise in artificial intelligence and other areas of computer science. I also use computer science techniques to extend the reach of game-theoretic models. With agent-based simulations, the task of constructing a normal-form game model can be simplified and even automated. With machine learning, game models and equilibrium computation can generalize from incomplete data. If you are a student who is interested in working on these problems, please stop by my office or send me an email. Publications Journal Papers Pranav Dandekar, Ashish Goel, Michael P.
