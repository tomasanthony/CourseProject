(Best Paper Award) Selected Work 1. Neuromorphic Computing Circuit Using Emerging Technologies Biologically-inspired computing platforms are highly-efficient for solving many problems, particularly in the voice, image, and video processing, by taking advantages of massive parallel low-power computing blocks. Compounded with emerging beyond-CMOS technologies, these neuromorphic circuits lead to significant improvement in computing energy efficiency. As an example, cellular neural network (CNN) is one promising type of non-Boolean computing system that can outperform the traditional digital logic computation and mitigate the physical scaling limit of the conventional CMOS technology. 17 Spintronic Cellular Neural Network and Its Functional Demonstration for Associative Memory Applications 2. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory Design To replace the conventional SRAM, DRAM, and floating gate-based FLASH memory, this project aims to develop high-density high-performance stand-alone non-volatile memory that is essential for energy-efficient computing systems. A variety of emerging technologies and memory architectures are investigated, and two examples are given as follow. Spintronic Memory 13 Fast Read and Write Spintronic SRAM Schematic, Layout, and Performance Projection 3D Crossbar Memory Array High-Density High-Performance 3D Crossbar Memory Array and Modeling 3. Hierarchical Optimization for Generic VLSI Systems To design next-generation high-performance low-power VLSI computing systems, this project develops a fast and efficient hierarchical optimization engine to explore various emerging beyond-CMOS technologies and system-level innovations. When developing new technology options, all critical design parameters across all levels of abstraction must be co-optimized simultaneously to maximize the overall chip throughput. A faster device does not guarantee a larger chip throughput, because the system could be limited by the leakage power, device footprint area, interconnect network, architecture, and/or memory bandwidth. The proposed optimization engine is highly efficient so that an exhaustive exploration and searching is feasible under area or power constraints. Several representative case studies are listed as follow: Device Optimization: Interconnect Optimization: System-Level Optimization: CMOS Planar/FinFET 25 Tunneling FET 27 Graphene PN Junction 28 Cu/Al Hybrid Interconnect 26 Multi-layer Graphene 29 Multiple Patterning Analysis 22 Power Delivery Network 30 3D Integration 31 Heterogeneous Integration 25 Variation-Aware Optimization 32 25 A Hierarchical Optimization Engine for Generic VLSI Systems 4. Beyond-CMOS Technology Exploration for Boolean and non-Boolean Applications Faced with the challenges and limitations of CMOS scaling, there is a global search for beyond-CMOS device technologies that are capable of augmenting or even replacing conventional Si CMOS technology and sustaining Moores Law.There is an increasing need for a uniform benchmarking methodology to capture and evaluate the latest research and development for various beyond-CMOS proposals. Such research is critical in identifying the key limiting factors for promising devices and in guiding future research directions through modification or even reinvention of proposed devices. 12 Beyond-CMOS Device Benchmarking for Boolean and Non-Boolean Logic Applications Selected Awards & Honors Research Spotlight Award , School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2018 Best in Session Award , Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) TECHCON, 2016 Best Paper Nomination , IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED), 2016 Top 5 Student Papers , IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conference (IITC), 2016 Best Paper Nomination , IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED), 2015 Best Student Paper Award , IEEE International Conference on IC Design and Technology (ICICDT), 2012 Best Paper Award , IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED), 2012 Outstanding Bachelor Thesis, School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2010 1st Prize , National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest in China, 2009 EECS Application Login EECS Gradplanner Login EECS Shop Department Events Please update your browser to view the iframe content.
