Chang is Professor and Director of Software Engineering Lab of the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. He received a PhD in computer science from Northwestern University in 1982, and worked for GTE Automatic Electric and Bell Laboratories before joining the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1984. He joined the Iowa State University in 2002 as department chair of computer science. He stepped down as chair after having served in that capacity for 11 years. During his tenure as the department chair he recruited an endowed chair and a group of talented young scholars, including six more NSF CAREER awardees, and significantly improved the department research capability and global visibility. His research interests include requirements engineering, software architecture, net-centric computing, software evolution and successful aging. His research has been supported by both National Science Foundation and industrial R&D. Chang is 2004 President of IEEE Computer Society. Previously he served as the Editor-in-Chief for IEEE Software (1991-94). He received the Computer Society's Meritorious Service Award, Outstanding Contribution Award, the Golden Core recognition, and the IEEE Third Millennium Medal. In 2006 he received the prestigious Marin Drinov Medal from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and was recognized by IBM with the IBM Faculty Award in 2006, 2007 and 2009. From 2007-2010 he served the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Computer, the flagship publication of IEEE Computer Society. He is the 2012 recipient of the Richard E. Merwin Medal from the IEEE Computer Society. He was named the 2014 Outstanding Alumnus by his alma mater, the National Central University of Taiwan. In September, 2014, the China Computer Federation (CCF) selected him as recipient of the prestigious Overseas Outstanding Contributions Award, annually extended to one of the internationally recognized computer scientists of Chinese origin outside China. Chang is Fellow of IEEE, Fellow of AAAS, and a member of the European Academy of Sciences.
