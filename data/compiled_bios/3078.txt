 Kelvin Gregory Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering Contact 123H Porter Hall Email 412-268-9811 412-268-7813 Address Civil & Environmental Engineering Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 Bio Kelvin Gregory is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering .His research interests lie in environmental biotechnology and biogeochemistry with a focus on the fundamental interactions between microorganisms and geochemistry, which influence the fate of environmental pollution.The goal of his research is to provide insight into the underlying science of enhanced engineering solutions for environmental challenges. The research in Gregorys lab is primarily experimental and applications-oriented as they apply to development of environmental technology. Current research projects include microbial ecology of agricultural plant tissues, water and sanitation in developing communities, and produced water from oil and natural gas development and CO 2 sequestration. In conjunction with the Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEINT) at Carnegie Mellon University, Gregorys research group explores the interactions between bacteria and nanoparticles for an enhanced understanding of the fate, transport, and toxicity of nanomaterials. He is the Faculty Advisor for the CMU Chapter of Engineers Without Borders and is interested in sustainable and appropriate water and energy technology for developing communities. Areas of Interest Environmental microbiology and biotechnology Benthic and microbial fuel-cells for remote and decentralized power generation Environmental biogeochemistry, electrode-based remediation of contaminated subsurfaces Bacteriology and microbial ecology of engineered systems Sustainable and appropriate technology in developing communities Education PhD 2002 - The University of Iowa Research Research Group: EESS Publications E McGivney, L Han, A Avellan, J VanBriesen, KB Gregory (2017) Disruption of Autolysis in Bacillus Subtilis Using TiO2 Nanoparticles, Scientific Reports, 7, 44308.
