On October12, 2012, Rice University celebrated it's Centennial , the 100-year anniversary of the University's founding. Read the excellent 1912 innaugural lecture by the first President of Rice, Edgar Odell Lovett, on " The Meaning of the New Institution ". Our paper on " EM-MAC: A Dynamic Multichannel Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks " won the Best Paper Award at the MobiHoc2011 conference! Welcome to Dave Johnson's home page! I am a tenured full Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the George R.Brown School of Engineering at Rice University . My home department is Computer Science, and I am also a member of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology (formerly, Computer and Information Technology Institute) at Rice. Before joinng the faculty at Rice in 2000, I was previously an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University , where I was a member of the faculty for eight years. Prior to 1992 when I joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon, Iwas also at Rice University . From 1989 through 1992, I was a Research Scientist and Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Rice. Before this, Iwas a graduate and undergraduate student at Rice, completing my Ph.D. (1990) and M.S. (1985) degrees in Computer Science and my B.A. (1982) with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. As a graduate student at Rice, my advisor was Willy Zwaenepoel (later Dean of the School of Computer and Communications Sciences at EPFL from 2002 to 2011). As an undergraduate, I was a member of Lovett College , one of eight (now eleven) residential colleges at Rice. Before that, I graduated from Spring High School (1978) in Spring, Texas, near Houston. My current research focus is in the area of protocols for wireless and mobile networking, and I am leading the Monarch (MObile Networking ARCHitectures) research group at Rice University in this area. I founded the Monarch research group (the Monarch Project ) in 1992 while on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University and have continued it since moving to Rice. I have worked substantially on the problems of MobileIP and different types of multihop wireless networking including mobile adhoc networking, sensor networking, and mesh networking. Related to this research, I have been active for many years in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal protocol standards development organization for the Internet, primarily in the MobileIP and Mobile AdHoc Networks (MANET) working groups. I also served from 2005 through 2009 as the Chair of ACMSIGMOBILE , the Association for Computing Machinery 's Special Interest Group on Mobility of Systems, Users, Data, and Computing , and am currently serving as a member of the ACM SIGGoverningBoard Executive Committee (SGBEC).
