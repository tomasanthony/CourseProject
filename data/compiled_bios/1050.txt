 Kyle Jamieson Department of Computer Science 35 Olden Street, Room 306 Princeton, NJ 08540 kylej at cs.princeton.edu, PGP key About Publications Teaching Talks Service I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University where I lead the PAWS Group , and adjunct Reader of Wireless Systems and Networks at University College London. Computer Science Undergraduate Independent Work project ideas (campus IP address and CS department user account required for access). This Spring semester I'm teaching an new undergraduate level class in Wireless Networks . Research My research interests are in all aspects of wireless networked systems, from the basic architecture of the wireless physical layer to high-level applications. The two main strands of work I have pursued involve bringing phased array signal processing indoors and improving the capacity of wireless networks in a world with many billions of wireless devices, most of which transmit in wireless spectrum that is unplanned by any central authority. For further information, see the Princeton Advanced Wireless Systems (PAWS) group website. Recruiting I am seeking graduate students and postdoctoral research associates with an interest in working on challenging open problems in wireless networks and systems to join the PAWS team. If you are interested, you must apply and be admitted to the graduate program at Princeton University. Because of the volume of mail I receive I regret that I'm not always able to reply to personal inquiries.
