 home projects papers blog gallery contact anil madhavapeddy // anil.recoil.org Anil Madhavapeddy I'm an engineer at Docker , and a University Lecturer at the University of Cambridge . I've worked in a variety of senior architecture, engineering, product management, sales and "whatever it takes" roles in industry ( S , M , L , XL ) as well as government and research ( S , M , L ). I completed my PhD in 2006 at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in the Systems Research Group . You can read my thesis and various academic publications here . My research goal is to improve the security, reliability and performance of the Internet. I lead the OCaml Labs group at Cambridge, and work on the MirageOS unikernel operating system as a new foundation for networked, multi-scale applications. I also develop open-source software such as the secure OpenBSD operating system. I'm online at Twitter , Facebook , LinkedIn , GitHub and Amazon . My old Citrix/Xen blog is still available for now and I also blog at MirageOS . I'm migrating most of my open-source projects over to github at the moment. I occasionally do consulting work, primarily on the commercial uses of functional programming. I'm a Fellow at Pembroke College, where I also serve as Director of Studies for Computer Science.
