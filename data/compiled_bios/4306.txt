Yann-Hang Lee Professor Yann-Hang Lee joined ASU in 2000. Before then he was a professor at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Lees research interests have centered on real-time embedded systems over the past few years. These systems have been a focus of growing interest in science and engineering disciplines. They have emerged as intelligent controllers in many large-scale infrastructure networks and coordinated subsystems on which our society and daily lives depend. Lees research explores scientific principles and technology to renew the development approaches for real-time embedded systems of a broad range of applications, including effective analysis, design and implementation methods to meet system requirements and application characteristics. yhlee@asu.edu 480-727-7507 Centerpoint 202-23 http://rts-lab.eas.asu.edu Education Ph.D., Computer and Information Engineering,University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1985 M.S., Electrical, Computer, System Engineering,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 1982 B.S., Engineering Science,National Cheng Kung University, 1973 Research interests Real-time computing, embedded system and software, fault-tolerant computing, distributed computing, and service-oriented computing Honors and awards  Best Paper Award ISEQED 2008 Outstanding Paper AwardMIXDES 2001  Key activities  Keynote  SNPD(07) and CAINE(06) Co-Chair ICESS(07) Advisory and Publicity Committee  ISORC(06) Steering Committee  SEUS(06) PC  WESE(06, 07, 08), SCC(06), IWEC(06), ESO(06), IWSSPS(06), SOCA(07), ICOIN(07), SEC(07), SAC(06)   February 23, 2015 CIDSE                      Sign In / Sign Out    Sign In     Menu    ASU Home  My ASU   Colleges & Schools   Arts and Sciences  Business  Design and the Arts  Education  Engineering  Future of Innovation in Society  Graduate  Health Solutions  Honors  Journalism  Law  Nursing and Health  Public Service and Community Solutions  Sustainability  University College  Thunderbird School of Global Management     Map & Locations   Map  Tempe  West  Polytechnic  Downtown Phoenix  Online and Extended  Lake Havasu  Skysong  Research Park  Washington D.C.
