My research centers on sequential decision making under uncertainty. From web advertising to robotic grasping to treating patients, decision making under uncertainty abounds, and the potential impact of better decision policies is enormous. I am particularly interested in creating algorithms with formal performance bounds for broad questions that are motivated by societal challenges, such as education. More generally, my research interests include reinforcement learning, machine learning, planning under partial observability, human agent interaction, and using information communication technologies for international development.
