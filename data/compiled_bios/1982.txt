 Additional Positions at AU Affiliate Faculty, Department of Computer Science Bio Stephen Casey is a founding member of the Editorial Board for Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing (STSIP) and an Associate Editor of The Journal of Signal and Image Processing. He was chair of the 11th biennial international conference on Sampling Theory and its Applications, and was named Guest Editor-in-Chief of STSIP in June 2015. His research is in complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and number theory with applications to signal and image processing, and includes work on multichannel deconvolution, multi-rate sampling, sampling in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, sampling for wideband signals, signal adaptive frame theory, and the analysis of pulse train signals. He has published over fifty articles, has given over one hundred invited talks, and has been funded by twenty research grants. A patent for his work on signal adaptive processing was awarded in September 2016, and a continuance of this is under patent review in 2018. He is also active in the classroom, receiving AU's 1998 University Faculty Award for Outstanding Teaching and the 1999 selection by the AU students for Outstanding Teaching. He received AU's 2010 Award for Teaching with Technology for his work in visualizing Complex Analysis using computer animations, and AU's 2012 Ideas Incubator Award for his work in Computational Science. :
