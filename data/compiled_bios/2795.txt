Cheriton School of Computer	Science	University of Waterloo	Research Interests	At the	Distributed Systems Lab our research interests are in the area of	computing systems with a special focus on distributed and operating	systems. I am interested in building highly efficient systems by	leveraging recent advances in hardware technology and by exploiting	domain specific optimizations. My current projects focus on building	software-defined storage system for workflow applications, exploring	fundamental reliability and scheduling problems in the Linux I/O	stack, and exploiting recent advances in software-defined networks	and multicore platforms to accelerate storage systems.	Short Bio	I completed my PhD at theNetworked	Systems Laboratoryin theElectrical and Computer Engineering	Department at The University of British Columbia, advised by Prof.Matei	Ripeanu. During my PhD I completed five internships at Microsoft	Research Lab, Microsoft Azure, IBM Research, NEC Lab, and Argonne	National Lab. After my PhD I joined the Computer Science Department	at the University of Wisconsin - Madison as a postdoc, working with	Prof.Andrea	Arpaci-Dusseauand Prof.Remzi	Arpaci-Dusseau, and theADSLresearch	group. Nowadays, I am an Assistant Professor at the David R. Cheriton	School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.	Longer CV can be found here.
