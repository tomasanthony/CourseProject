Membersofour groupare conducting cutting-edge research in Electromagnetic Fields &Wavesfor applications including terrestrial and satellite wireless telecommunications,sub-wavelength imaging and sensing, radars, defense, medical diagnostics &therapeutics, nanoplasmonics,and high-speed digital interconnects. Our philosophy is based on the discovery and explanation of new physical phenomena that lead togroundbreaking and useful inventions. To enable this approach, our group has been a pioneer in the emerging field of electromagnetic metamaterials and metasurfaces: An arrangement of scatterers that give rise to unusual phenomena such as negative refraction. Our research activities range from microwaves (microscale) to optics (nanoscale) and are driven by scientific curiosity and practical applications. ELEFTHERIADES' GROUP aaaaaaaaaaaaiii
