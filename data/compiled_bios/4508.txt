My father is a well-known Tamil writer (pen name: Umachandran, author of the award winning novel "Mullum Malarum" in the Kalki magazine , which was made into a hit movie starring Rajnikanth ). My older brother R. Nataraj , is a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the State of Tamilnadu, India (previously, he was the Director General of Police for the Tamilnadu State). I am married to Vasanthi , and we have two children Hemant and Shalini . As of 7/30/2017, I have a new status in life...a grandpa...Shalini and her husband Sunil have given me this status boost through their baby boy Shashvat. I am an avid squash player, and can be arm-twisted to hold a tennis racket every once in a while! Check out my daughter's assessment (at age 9) of how I look by clicking here . Check out what I did during the winter break (2009-2010) by clicking here . Professionally Speaking... I received my Ph. D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1986 under the direction of Marvin Solomon . Since then I have been with Georgia Tech (home of the yellow jackets), where currently I am a Professor in the College of Computing. Recently, I led a faculty team that defined the curriculum and the implementation for an online MS program in Computer Science ( OMSCS ) using MOOC technology for the College of Computing, which is currently providing an opportunity for students to pursue a low-cost graduate education in computer science internationally. In the past, I have served as the Director of STAR Center from 2007 to 2014 (collaborative research between Samsung and Georgia Tech), and as the Director of Korean Programs for the College of Computing from 2007 to 2011 (offering an MS in Embedded Software in S. Korea funded by the South Korean Government aimed at students coming from leading industries such as Samsung and LG). For two years (July 2003 to August 2005) I served as the Chair of the Core Computing Division within the College of Computing. My research interests are in the area of architectural design, programming, and analysis of parallel and distributed systems. Currently, I am leading a project that deals with large-scale situation awareness using distributed camera networks and multi-modal sensing with applications to surveillance, connected vehicles, and transportation. In the past, I have been involved in the design and evaluation of several large experimental systems including Clouds, Beehive , Stampede (joint with (RIP) Compaq Cambridge Research Lab ), and ubiquitous presence (sensor-based distributed computing). I received a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1990, the Georgia Tech Doctoral Thesis Advisor Award in 1993, the College of Computing Outstanding Senior Research Faculty Award in 1996, the College of Computing Dean's Award in 2003 and 2014, the William A. "Gus" Baird Faculty Teaching Award from the College of Computing in 2004, the Peter A. Freeman Faculty Award from the College of Computing in 2009 and in 2013, the Outstanding Faculty Mentor Award from the College of Computing in 2014, and became an IEEE Fellow in 2014.
