 Dr. Steven Pearce School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University Curriculum Vitae Favorite Quote: "[O]ur comparative ignorance of the laws of society and history is due not only to the great complexity of human affairs, but also to the very prejudice that there are no laws of history - a prejudice suspect of being allied to powerful social (or antisocial) interests that are vitally interested in preventing deep insights into the social mechanism . Et pour cause! People who are able to take the social mechanism apart in theory may wish to change it in practice , and - what is more dangerous for those who live on the persistence of fossil social forms - such men may even succeed in their attempt." -- Mario Bunge From the Peak (September 12, 2000): CMPT 320 was cited as one "... of the Best Classes at SFU".
