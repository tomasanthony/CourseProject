 I have three research areas: (a) semantics and logics for probabilistic systems and languages (b) machine learning and (c) quantum information theory. I work on approximation of continuous-state systems and associated metrics and logics. I am working on a quantitative extension of equational logic which allows one to carry out approximate reasoning equationally. I have been working on Stone duality for Markov processes and completeness theorems for Markovian logics. I am also interested in duality for automata and using it for minimization. Recently I have begun working on diffusion and similar continuous-time Markov processes . I have not been active in quantum information theory for a year but I hope to return to it soon. I am organizing a workshop at Bellairs on Higher-order probabilistic computation. My co-authors, Richard Blute, Josee Desharnais, Abbas Edalat and I won the 2017 Test-of-Time Award from LICS for our 1997 paper on bisimulation for labelled Markov processes. The editorial boards on which I serve are accessible through Links above.
