 Home Contact Teaching Research About Me Prof. Dan Fleck Dan Fleck Teaching I am not teaching any classes this semester. Older classes are on my teaching page . Research Interests System Security : I am interested in many aspects of computer security. I have lead projects in malware understanding and analysis, network intrusion detection, system forensics, and anomaly detection in applications to detect malware. A common thread in my work is applying machine learning anomaly detection techniques to security problems to develop real systems which can detect threats without exemplar data. The projects I lead are within GMU's Center for Assurance Research & Engineering (CARE) . Computer Vision : Throughout my initial research career I worked on computer vision algorithms for image matching and reconstruction. Although I'm not currently active in this area, my early work applying pattern matching in computer vision influences my security research. Teaching Philosophy Students are our customers, treat them as such. Motivate students to learn by providing interesting assignments, and sharing my passion about Computer Science. Have fun! 2017 Dan Fleck all rights reserved.
