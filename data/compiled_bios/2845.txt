Naomi Nishimura	Naomi Nishimura	Algorithms and Complexity Group	David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science	University of Waterloo	Research	My main area of interest is in algorithms, especially for graph problems, specializing in parameterized algorithms, reconfiguration problems, and the confluence of the two.	I recently co-organized a Banff International Research Station workshop on Combinatorial Reconfiguration.	Slides from a recent overview talk on reconfiguration, given at CanaDAM 2017, can be found here.	A survey on reconfiguration that I wrote for a special issue can be found here.	An excellent bibliography of papers relating to reconfiguration can be found here.	To join our new mailing list for researchers interested in reconfiguration, please go to the following page:	For more information on reconfiguration, please visit the new	web portal.	A list of my papers can be found at the Computer Science bibliography	site.	Teaching	My current teaching project involves the development and redevelopment of non-major courses, including CS 231 and CS 234. I am involved in on-going teaching for the Master of Mathematics for Teachers.	Past projects have included teaching a course for the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences. and developing courseware for the Faculty of Mathematics' Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing.	Administration	I am currently the advisor for coursework Master's students. Please note that my role is limited to providing advice on selection of courses; for logistics and bureaucracy, please contact the CS Graduate Office instead.	Please consult the FAQ for answers to questions you may have.
