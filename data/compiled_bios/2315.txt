Brahim Bensaou Associate Professor Rm 3537 Lift 25/26 The Department of Computer Science and Engineering brahim@cse.ust.hk +852 2358-7014 +852 2358-1477 Teaching Fall 1 Sept 2017 - 24 Dec 2017 COMP5621: Computer Networks CSIT5610: Computer Networking and Internet Perspective Spring 1 Feb 2018 - 30 May 2018 COMP4511: System and Kernel Programming in Linux Short Bio. Professor Bensaou is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST. Prior to that he was a Senior Member of Technical Staff, and the Leader of the Networks strategic research group at Singapore's national R&D Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC, now under A*Star I2R after a merger of two such centres). He has earned his Doctorate degree from Universit Paris 6 Jussieu, France, under the co-supervision of Prof. Guy Pujolle and Dr James W. Roberts at France Telecom Research Labs where he did all his PhD research within the "high speed networks teletraffic research group". Professor Bensaou's research interests are diverse but lie primarily in the area of resource allocation, resource sharing and quality of service and teletraffic in network systems, including wireless local- and wide-area networks, information-centric networks, data centre networks, software-defined networks and the Internet at large. He has supervised 13 PhD theses and about 20 MPhil/MEng theses (both at HKUST and NUS when he was with the CWC in Singapore). He is a Senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM.
