I build computer systems for all scales of use, from datacenters to biomedical devices. Im currently designing chips for brain implants and systems for brain modeling with my PhD students,Guilherme Cox,Jn Vesel, andZi Yan, as well as my undergraduate mentees,Lucas Marin, andKarthik Sriram.My group has influenced the wayvirtual memoryis implemented on modern computer systems. We are the inventors ofcoalesced TLBs, which AMD first implemented in itsRyzenarchitecture. We have proposed OS mechanisms for superpage management and have integrated them in theLinux 4.14 kernel series. We are also the creators of a generic interface for direct system call invocation from GPUs. Our code is hosted under theRadeon Open Computeumbrella.
