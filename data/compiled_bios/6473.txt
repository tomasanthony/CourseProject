Office: 4130 CSE Building Phone: (858) 534-6640 Faculty Assistant: Alice Carr Email: apcarr you-know-what eng.ucsd.edu Phone: (858) 534-5151 I direct the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program (IDP) in Cognitive Science. ...and I direct(ed) the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center. Before emailing me about the IDP, please read this presentation on it that I wrote for incoming Neuroscience grads. Interdisciplinary Program Graduate Coordinator: Oura Neak Email: cogsphd you-know-what ucsd.edu Phone: 858-534-7141 I am a Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering Department at UCSD . This means I can now go barefoot and there is nothing they can do about it! I am a member of the AI Group at UCSD . My research group, Gary's Unbelievable Research Unit , publishes unbelievable research. Our research is strongly interdisciplinary. It concerns using neural networks and other computational models applied to problems in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, engineering and biology. I have had success using them for such disparate tasks as modeling how children acquire words, studying how lobsters chew, and nonlinear data compression. Most recently I have worked on face and object recognition, visual salience and visual attention, and modeling early visual cortex.
