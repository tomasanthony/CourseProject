Technical reports and old papers Thesis (1975) General description of research goals Finding efficient algorithms for fundamental practical problems by studying important algorithms at all levels through the design-analysis-implementation cycle. Validating theoretical designs through practical implementations; uncovering fundamental properties of algorithms through careful mathematical performance analyses; comparing algorithms through careful implementation studies. Developing general mechanisms relating algorithms, data structures, generating functions and analytic functions such that asymptotic results useful in predicting performance of the algorithms can be derived automatically and economically. Investigating the way in which visual representations can provide an understanding of how algorithms gain efficiency, including dynamic graphical simulations of algorithms in operation and high-quality static representations suitable for use in publications.
