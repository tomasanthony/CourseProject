Past projects I have implemented a new rendering model to capture the fine lighting effects of stalactites and stalagmites. Satyan Coorg worked on creating the models of the stalactites and stalagmites. I captured the interference patterns formed by thin oil films/slicks on water using Renderman. Kavita Bala's Projects Perception of Complex Scenes Rendering and modeling complex scenes is challenging. Understanding and exploiting how humans perceive complex scenes is an important area in graphics. We have worked on multiple projects in this area. Understanding how we perceive complex geometric aggregates is an open problem. We study the perception of aggregates to derive metrics for scene simplification (SIG '08) ( Project ). Standard image fidelity qualities are limiting and do not necessarily capture what is visually important to a graphics practitioner. Visual Equivalence (SIG '07) aims at a new standard of image fidelity that captures what is important in preserving the appearance of objects in a scene ( Project ). Scalable high-complexity rendering Rendering high complexity scenes including complex illumination and rendering effects such as motion blur, participating media, global illumination, and depth-of-field, is challenging. Multidimensional lightcuts (SIG '06) and lightcuts (SIG '05) present a unified, scalable rendering framework to efficiently render complex scenes with such effects. By unifying complex illumination into one framework we achieve high scalability and accurate imagery. ( Multidimensional Lightcuts Project , Subsurface Lightcuts Project , Lightcuts Project ). Scalable previewing for cinematic rendering Previewing still images and animations of scenes with high geometric and illumination complexity, and arbitrary shading models, is useful for applications such as cinematic lighting design. Matrix row-column sampling (SIG '07) treats rendering as the evaluation of a very large matrix of pixel-light interactions; this matrix can be efficiently approximated by evaluating a very small set of pixels, and using them to cluster lights globally, for a fast approximation of the image ( Project ). Tensor clustering extends this idea to render animations including deforming characters. This work extends the row-column sampling approach to tensors, and introduces a clustering metric that minimizes temporal flicker ( Project ). Scene Editing and Cinematic Relighting Lighting designers and modelers need interactive feedback while designing scenes. Direct-to-indirect transfer (SIG '06), is an interactive relighting engine that uses GPUs to compute indirect illumination as a designer moves lights in a scene. Efficient precomputation and rendering enable high performance, while supporting arbitrary light shaders and high complexity scenes. ( Project ). When a user changes the scene (but not the lighting), rapidly identifying the parts of the radiance computation that are affected by user manipulation is difficult. 5D Ray Segment Trees (EGRW '99) efficiently identify affected radiance interpolants and incrementally ray trace images. ( Project). Feature-Based Graphics The human visual system is sensitive to features such as silhouettes and shadows. Edge-and-point rendering (SIG '03) identifies visually important features (edges) and combines them with sparse, expensive shading samples to achieve interactive rendering with global illumination. This approach bridges the gap between expensive, high-quality rendering and fast, interactive display. Project , GPU implementation project (GI '06) Feature-based textures (EGSR '04) are a resolution-independent representation of textures that capture visually important features. FBT Project Detail Synthesis Detail synthesis (I3D '03) adds visually plausible detail to textures created by image-based modeling. This approach identifies areas of poor detail in extracted textures and automatically creates higher resolution detail for uniformly high-quality textures. Project Constrained Minimization Synthesis (TVCG '06) casts detail synthesis and image analogies as an energy minimization problem, and uses graph cut techniques to synthesize textures while satisfying constraints. Project Direct Illumination Adaptive shadow maps (SIG '01) address the fundamental problem of shadow map aliasing by adaptively changing shadow map resolution based on viewpoint. ASM Project Local illumination environments (EGSR '02) capture the part of the environment that influences shading at each part of a scene. This approach enables rendering with complex direct illumination including hundreds of lights. LIE Project Iterative adaptive sampling (TVCG '06) efficiently renders scenes with many lights by adapting the sampling distribution of the lights in a multipass algorithm. Radiance Interpolants Expensive shading is often smooth and can be often interpolated from sparse samples. Radiance interpolants (TOG '99) are 4D radiance samples that are quadrilinearly interpolated to rapidly approximate radiance with bounded approximation error. Radiance interpolants capture object-space, ray-space, image-space and temporal coherence in the radiance function. Radiance interpolants Project Unpublished research I have implemented a new rendering model to capture the fine lighting effects of stalactites and stalagmites. Satyan Coorg worked on creating the models of the stalactites and stalagmites. Complete List of Publications... Kavita Bala's Bio Kavita Bala is the Chair of the Computer Science Department at Cornell University. She received her S.M. and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and her B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT, Bombay). She was a post doctoral researcher at the Program of Computer Graphics. She co-founded GrokStyle (acquired by Facebook), and is a faculty Fellow with the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Bala specializes in computer vision and computer graphics, leading research in recognition and visual search using deep learning; material modeling and acquisition using physics and learning; realistic, physically-based rendering; and material and lighting perception. Bala's work on scalable rendering, Lightcuts, is the core production rendering engine in Autodesk's cloud renderer; and her instance recognition research is the core technology of GrokStyle's visual search engine. Her work on 3D Mandalas was featured at the Rubin Museum of Art, New York. Bala serves on SIGGRAPH's Papers Advisory Group (PAG). Bala has served as the Editor-in-Chief of Transactions on Graphics (TOG), on the Papers Advisory Board for SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia, and as Associate Editor for TOG (Transactions on Graphics), TVCG (Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics) and CGF (Computer Graphics Forum). Bala has co-authored the graduate-level textbook "Advanced Global Illumination" (A K Peters publisher, second edition). She has chaired SIGGRAPH Asia 2011, and co-chaired Pacific Graphics (2010) and the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering (2005). Bala has received the NSF CAREER award, Cornell's College of Engineering Fiona Li and Donald Li Excellence in Teaching Award (2015), James and Mary Tien Excellence in Teaching Award (2006 and 2009), and the Affinito-Stewart award.
