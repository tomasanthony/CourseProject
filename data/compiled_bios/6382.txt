Welcome to visit the Web Intelligent Systems and Economics (WISE) Lab at Rutgers:http://wise.cs.rutgers.eduOur research area is inMachine Learning and Data Mining,Information Retrieval andRecommender Systems, and Internet Economics.Within the above areas, our recent research focuses on the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Mining, Recommendation and Search Systems, Knowledge Graphs, and Computational Economics, including 1) Intelligent and Explainable Decision Making Systems  developing explainable machine learning theories and algorithms for decision making systems such as recommendation and search; 2) Internet Economics  designing economic-aware machine learning algorithms and theories in web-based systems such as recommendation, search, and sharing economy;3) Conversational Search, Recommendation, and QA algorithms based on neural networks. My group is also broadly interested in "Personalized X", including Personalized Recommendation, Search, Education, Chatbots, etc.In the previous I was a postdoc in the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at UMass Amherst, and did my PhD and BE in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a BS in Economics at Peking Univeristy. I am a Siebel Scholar of the class 2015.
