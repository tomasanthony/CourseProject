User Experience Design User experience design (UX, UXD, or UED) is the process of enhancing user experience by improving usability, accessibility, and pleasure from interaction     Know what customers think about your product. Contact us Tools & Services       EEG   Sensors placed on the surface of the scalp non-invasively record electrical channels sampled at 256 times per second. Raw brain responses can be translated into measurements of attention, excitement, engagement, frustration or cognitive load. Data can be synchronized with eye tracking, galvanic skin response, and facial expression data to produce a complete array of evidence of user response to stimuli.        Eye Tracking   Infrared cameras capture visual attention and fixation. By recording eye movement, eye tracking technology is able to record fixation points and how long a user gazes at certain elements. This data can be used to create heat maps of focus by users. Eye tracking can be used in coordination with EEG and galvanic skin response.        Lab Environment   iLUX provides a state-of-the-art lab environment located at the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. A complete range of equipment, trained technicians, data analysts, and consultants are available for research ranging from website and device usability to shopper and advertising and biomedical.        Data Mining and Data Analysis   In coordination with the Arizona State University School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, iLUX is able to provide state-of-the-art data mining and data analysis services that can help you make sense of  and visualize the data you are gathering.        Experimental Design and Results Interpretation   iLUX provides expert consultation with PhD researchers to assist in the construction of experiments with a high degree of validity and reliability with proper controls and isolation of variables to ensure results that are publishable and defendable.
