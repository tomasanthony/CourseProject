 Diane Pozefskys work at IBM transformed IBMs networking technology to allow networks to change and adapt more easily. In the early nineties, as corporations moved toward TCP/IP networks, Diane developed the AnyNet technology, which broke the barriers between IBMs proprietary technology (SNA) and TCP/IP, allowing programs designed for one type of network to work on the other and allowing users to build networks that employed either or both technologies. In the late nineties, Diane changed her focus to building networks for the 1998 Nagano Olympics and the IBM Corporation. Throughout her career, Diane was an active author and inventor, publishing more than 25 papers and filing more than 20 patents. She was also active in supporting women in IBM and in the promotion of National Engineers Week. Diane received her A.B. from Brown University and her Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her dissertation,Building Efficient Pass-Oriented Attribute Grammar Evaluators,was done under the supervision of Mehdi Jazayeri. Diane lives in Chapel Hill with her husband, Mark; they have one daughter, Lauren, who is an environmental specialist with the federal government. Outside of work, Diane enjoys travel and has visited all seven continents.
