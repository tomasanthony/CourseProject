My main research interests are program analysis and verification, program synthesis, and automated logical reasoning. I obtained all my degrees (BS, MS, PhD) at Stanford University . I am a 2015 Sloan Fellow and a recipient of an NSF CAREER award. Research My main research interests are static program analysis/verification, program synthesis, and automated logical reasoning. I am interested in developing tools and novel techniques to make software systems more secure and reliable. In particular, my research focuses on automatically proving the absence of certain classes of errors (e.g., memory safety errors, assertion failures etc.) and security vulnerabilities in software. I am also interested in techniques for automatically synthesizing programs from formal or informal specifications.
