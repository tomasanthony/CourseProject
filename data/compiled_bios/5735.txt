Deschutes Hall University of Oregon Eugene, OR 97403 office: (541) 346-3414 fax: (541) 346-5373 email: art@cs.uoregon.edu Research Projects Network Design We consider the design of optimal networks having favorable properties for various group communication tasks, e.g., broadcasting or gossiping, for various reliability parameters, and for general algorithm efficiency. Artificial Evolution By studying simplified models of evolution, we hope to uncover underlying principles that are valuable for both the theoretical study of evolution and applications of evolutionary computing. Applied Artificial Intelligence We have studied a variety of applications of methods from artificial intelligence to problems in learning game agents, fall prediction, and complex systems modelng and reasoning.
