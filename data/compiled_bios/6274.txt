Laboratory for Advanced Power Conversion and Systems Analysis Research for the Real World Skip to content LAPCSA Research People Publications Contact LAPCSA The Laboratory for Advanced Power Conversion and Systems Analysis (LAPCSA), is a research centre at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of Toronto directed by Professor Peter Lehn . The group is dedicated to conducting advanced research in the field of Electrical Energy Systems with focus on power electronics and power systems. Of particular interest is development of new power converter topologies, analytical and simulation models, control schemes, and experimental systems that form core technologies and tools to support a transition towards more sustainable electrical power systems with expanded integration of renewable energy sources . LAPCSAs scope of expertiseextends to power systems , FACTS and HVDC systems, renewable energy and energy storage integration, DC and AC microgrids, and electric vehicle drivetrain and charging infrastructure.
