 Marijn J.H. Heule Research Scientist at The University of Texas at Austin Short Bio I am a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin and received my PhD at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 2008. My research focuses on solving hard-combinatorial problems in areas such as formal verification, number theory, and extreme combinatorics. Most of my contributions are related to theory and practice of satisfiability (SAT) solving. I have developed award-winning SAT solvers , and my preprocessing techniques are used in state-of-the-art SAT solvers. My current research focusses on two major challenges for SAT solving: 1) exploiting the potential of high-performance computing; and 2) validating the results of SAT solvers and related tools. I have been developing a novel parallel SAT solving paradigm, called cube-and-conquer , which enables linear time speedups on many hard problems. The first publication on cube-and-conquer won the best paper award at HVC 2011. The increasing complexity of SAT solvers and related tools makes it more likely that these tools contain bugs. I designed a new proof format and implemented a fast, corresponding proof checker for SAT and QBF solvers. Proof-logging in this format has been mandatory for the SAT Competitions since 2013, thereby increasing the confidence that tools produce correct results. By constructing and validating a proof for the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem (200 TB in size), I showed that proof logging and verification is even possible for the hardest problems. I am one of the editors of the Handbook of Satisfiability . This 900+ page handbook has become a standard for the SAT community, and it is a tremendous resource for future scientists. I am an Associate Editor of the Journal on Satisfiability, Boolean Modeling and Computation and was a co-chair of the SAT 2015 conference in Austin. My resume offers more details.

[ slides ] Software DRAT-trim website , GitHub DRAT-trim is a satisfiability proof checking and trimming utility designed to validate proofs for all known satisfiability solving and preprocessing techniques. DRAT-trim can also emit trimmed formulas, optimized proofs, and TraceCheck+ dependency graphs. QRAT-trim website QRAT-trim is a proof checking utility for quantified Boolean formulas and is based on the QRAT proof system. The tool also supports the conversion of QRAT proofs into Skolem functions. Cube-and-Conquer sources The cube-and-conquer parallel SAT solving paradigm combines look-ahead techniques for splitting with conflict-driven clause-learning techniques. March sources The March SAT solver (latest version march_br) is based on the lookahead architecture. It is the latest version in the march family of solvers, which won many medals at various SAT competitions. See the SAT 2004 paper for details. DRUP-trim website DRUP-trim is a proof checking utility based on the reverse unit propagation redundancy property. The tool was used to validate the results of SAT Competition 2013. Design adapted from KamSolutions and uses Bootstrap .
