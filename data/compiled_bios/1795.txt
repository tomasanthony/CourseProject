It is driven by applications in biosciences , computational relativity and geophysics , such as cardiovascular mechanics, binary black-hole mergers, and seismic wave propagation. My research has resulted in the development of state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for adaptive mesh refinement , geometric multigrid , fast Gauss transform and sorting .
