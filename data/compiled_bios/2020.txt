 Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira Assistant Professor, The University of Hong Kong. Dept. of Computer Science Office: CB420, Chow Yei Chin Building, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong Telephone: (+852) 2219 4800 Fax: (+852) 2559 8447 Email: bruno at cs.hku.hk Research Interests My interests are centered around programming languages. My existing research is mainly focused on type systems for modularity and the combination of Object-Oriented and Functional Paradigms. I am a member of the IFIP Working Group 2.1 (Algorithmic Languages and Calculi) , a steering committee member of the Workshop on Generic Programming and a steering committee member of the Haskell Symposium . HKU PL Group I lead the HKU PL group . Please visit our group web page for more information! PhD Position Available: I have one PhD position available! If you are interested please drop me an email! Experience with functional languages (such as Haskell, OCaml, Agda, Idris and Scala) is welcome, but not strictly necessary. Other Resources about my research It can be tricky to search for information about my research because of my 5 word, ``unconventional'' yet somewhat common name. Thus, here are a few helpful links: Google Scholar - A list of my papers/drafts at google scholar. ACM - A complete, but unsound list of my ACM publications. DBLP - The quickest way to get a bibtex file for citing my papers :). Microsoft Academic - Another cool academic website from Microsoft.
