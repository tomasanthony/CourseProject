If you're fascinated by privacy and/or security, please contact me by e-mail with details of your qualifications. About Me I received my BSc from HKUST in 2010 and my MMath and PhD from the University of Waterloo in 2012 and 2016 respectively. I have published papers at multiple top security and privacy venues, and I am serving on the Program Committee of the Privacy Enhancing Symposium 2017. I am a member of the newly established Cybersecurity Lab at HKUST. Curriculum Vitae and List of Publications Google Scholar page Research My research is in privacy and security, with a special focus on anonymity networks. During my PhD, I studied the problem of website fingerprinting , with which a local, passive eavesdropper can identify the pages visited by a web-browsing client, even if the client was using proxies and encryption. I wrote my thesis, titled "Website Fingerprinting: Attacks and Defenses" , on this topic. Teaching I taught COMP3632 (Principles of Cybersecurity) in Spring 2016/2017. I taught CS 458/658 (Computer Security and Privacy) for Fall 2015 at the University of Waterloo.
