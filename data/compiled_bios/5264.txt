Eli earned both his Bachelors Degree and Masters Degree in Computer Science at Ben Gurion University in Israel. He earned his PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2003. Elis research areas include Formal Methods, Software Engineering and his main field of research and teaching Programming languages. Eli, a native of Ein-HaBsor, Israel, is also a member of nuPRL, located in 308 West Village H. Eli is interested in programming languages of all kinds. He has studied computer music and applied logic, and he believes that programming languages are important to study for anyone interested in becoming a software developer. What are your research interests? I have gone through some interesting areas in my studies. I studied Computer Music (because I wanted to do programming languages) and Applied Logic (because I wanted to do programming languages.) Ive always been around many kinds of reflection, mainly in Programming Languages. What do you enjoy most/find most rewarding about what you teach? Is there anything notable or unique about the kind of students that you teach? In addition to finding the topic of Programming Languages personally fascinating, I also believe that it is an extremely important subject for a good CS degree and that includes people whose goal is to become software developers. How did you get into the computer science field? I discovered computers while I was in the fifth grade, and I have been hacking ever since then. What are the specifics of your industry experience? Im also working in the real world, but that is primarily to be able to say with authority that yes, programming languages are extremely important in academic CS and in the commercial world. :
