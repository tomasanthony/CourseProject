CJ's research interests focus on computer vision and robotics. His work on problems related to recovering 3-D models from 2-D images has led to commercially deployed techniques for recovering architectural models. CJ has also developed algorithms for recovering the posture of articulated figures, such as humans from photographs and video footage. His current research include work on self-localizing embedded smart camera systems and their applications to problems such as automated surveying systems, ad-hoc surveillance systems, three-dimensional reconstruction and mobile robot localization.
