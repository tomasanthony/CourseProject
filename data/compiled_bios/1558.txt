 Robert C. Duvall Lecturer Duke University Department of Computer Science D228 LSRC Box 90129 Durham, NC 27708-0129 rcd@cs.duke.edu Welcome to my homepage. If you came looking for the "real" Robert Duvall (i.e., the actor), I am sorry to disappoint you. To my knowledge, he does not have his own homepage, but you can find news and information about him here . If you are still reading, thank you for taking your time to visit my homepage. I hope you find something here worthwhile. I would tell you that these pages are under construction, but I believe that web pages should always be under construction. So you might want to come back occasionally to see if anything has been added. At Duke, I work with Owen Astrachan , Kristin Stephens-Martinez , Jeff Forbes , and Susan Rodger as a member of the Computer Science Education Group . Previously, I received both my B.S. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from Brown University while working on upgrading the introductory Computer Science sequence to use object-oriented programming. Teaching As a lecturer, I primarily teach the introductory programming courses. I enjoy talking to students, so feel free to drop by my office anytime. I also answer email as often as I can, but the advantage of coming to my office is that you can help reduce my overfull bowl of candy. Currently I am teaching the following courses: CompSci 307: Software Design and Implementation CompSci 308: Advanced Software Design and Implementation Previous courses If you are a Duke student wondering which Computer Science course to start with, there is an excellent guide to help clarify the issues here . Please consider applying to be a CompSci UTA!
