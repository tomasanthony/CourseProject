 Toggle navigation Home Publications Teaching Contact Yang Cai Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Yale University Biography I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Economics (secondary appointment) at Yale University . Prior to joining Yale, I was an Assistant Professor in the Schools of Computer Science at McGill University. I did my postdoc with Christos Papadimitriou at UC Berkeley. Before that, I finished my Ph.D. at MIT in Computer Science under the supervision of Costis Daskalakis and received my B.Sc. in EECS at Peking University. Current students: Mingfei Zhao , Mashbat Suzuki (co-supervised with Adrian Vetta ), Johannes Brustle, Paul Pereira (co-supervised with Doina Precup ). Prospective graduate students interested in working with me please apply directly to Yales PhD program .
