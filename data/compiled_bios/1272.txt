Walid G. Aref Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 1999 EducationBSc, Alexandria University, Egypt, Computer Science (1983) MSc, Alexandria University, Egypt, Computer Science (1986) PhD, University of Maryland at College Park, Computer Science (1993) Walid G. Aref is a professor of computer science at Purdue. His research interests are in extending the functionality of database systems in support of emerging applications, e.g., spatial, spatio-temporal, graph, biological, and sensor databases. He is also interested in query processing, indexing, data streaming, and geographic information systems (GIS). Walid's research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Health, Purdue Research Foundation, CERIAS, Panasonic, and Microsoft Corp. In 2001, he received the CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation and in 2004, he received a Purdue University Faculty Scholar award. Walid is a member of Purdue's CERIAS. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions of Spatial Algorithms and Systems (ACM TSAS), an editorial board member of the Journal of Spatial Information Science (JOSIS), and has served as an editor of the VLDB Journal and the ACM Transactions of Database Systems (ACM TODS). Walid has won several best paper awards including the 2016 VLDB ten-year best paper award. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, and a member of the ACM. Between 2011 and 2014, Walid has served as the chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (SIGSPATIAL). Selected PublicationsM.S. Hassan, W.G. Aref, A.M.
