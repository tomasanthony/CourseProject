More News ...                                     Currently Teaching           None (Winter 2019)           ... More Classes ...                                     Research                        I enjoy developing and deploying             programming language technology              type systems, synthesis algorithms,             and other program analysis techniques              for applications in software engineering             and human-computer interaction.             Currently, the overarching theme of my research             is to develop             Direct Manipulation Programming Systems.                                                                  active projects                                                                                               [Sketch-n-Sketch]                 Graphical user interfaces are great, but the lack of                 programmability in a high-level language makes it difficult to develop                 complex and reusable content. Sketch-n-Sketch is a                 direct manipulation programming system                 for interactively creating documents                  such as graphic designs, web pages, and spreadsheets                  that aims for a seamless combination of programming and direct manipulation.                                                                                                                [Deuce]                 Text editors are great, but coding involves tedious,                 error-prone edits that hinder productivity and creativity.                 Deuce is a structure-aware code editor that provides direct manipulation                 interactions for quickly performing programming and refactoring tasks.                                                                                                                [Hazel with CU Boulder and CMU]                                       Programming environments are great, but they typically provide little                 help for incomplete programs  those that are syntactically                 ill-formed or ill-typed.                 This project develops semantic foundations for programming environments                 to continuously edit, reason about, and run programs with holes.                                                                                   older projects                                                                                               [Dependent JavaScript @ UCSD]                 Scripting languages include features that frustrate                 static reasoning, such as extensible objects, dynamically computed                 keys, loosely coupled recursion, reflection, and dynamic code loading.                 This project aims to develop type systems to                 describe idiomatic programs in scripting languages                 such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.                                                                                                     [Radar @ UCSD]                 Defining a dataflow analysis for concurrent programs is complicated                 by the subtleties of thread interleavings and locking protocols.                 Radar automatically converts a sequential dataflow analysis to a                 concurrent one by making use of datarace information from the                 Relay race detector for C programs.                                                                                                     [Staged Information Flow @ UCSD]                 The prevalence of dynamically loaded code makes program analysis for                 JavaScript difficult.                 We present a staged approach to tracking information flow that splits the                 analysis burden between compile-time and run-time.                                                                                                     [Fine @ Microsoft Research]                 Modern SMT solvers allow refinement type systems to track security                 and other complex properties, but they become a large part of the                 compiler\'s trusted computing base (TCB). Fine incorporates a type-preserving                 translation to eliminate the solver from the TCB.                 Fine is a precursor to MSR\'s                 F* language.
