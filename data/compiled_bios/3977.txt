 Scott Aaronson I'm David J. Bruton Centennial Professor of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin , and director of its Quantum Information Center . Prior to coming here, I taught for nine years in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. My research interests center around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers, and computational complexity theory more generally.
