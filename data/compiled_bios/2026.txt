I have made fundamental research contributions on the topics of collision detection, shape modeling and analysis, mesh generation, and architectural geometry. My current interests include the following topics: data analysis and visualization, virtual reality, 3D printing, robotics, interactive shape modeling, shape analysis, mesh generation, 3D reconstruction from scanned data and images. I am recruiting Ph.D. students and postdoc fellows in all these areas. I am interested in candidates with outstanding academic records and passion for research, plus proven research ability if already possessing a Master degree or Ph.D. degree. I have also worked on a number of interdisciplinary projects that apply computer visualization technology to water environment engineering, medical science, and chemistry. One of these projects, Waterman , integrates cutting-edge hydraulic and information technology to develop software for effective environment impact assessment and its visualization.
