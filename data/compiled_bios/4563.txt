 Jivko Sinapov The James Schmolze Assistant Professor in Computer Science Tufts University Home Research Publications Teaching Group CV I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Tufts University . I joined the department in the Fall of 2017. My main research interests lie in Cognitive and Developmental Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, Robot Learning, and Computational Perception. The question that interests me most is, ``What is intelligence and how can it be implemented in a physical robot?''. My current focus is on enabling robots to operate in and learn about human-inhabited environments for extended periods of time. In the Spring of 2017, I co-organized a 2017 AAAI Spring Symposium titled Interactive Multi-Sensory Perception for Embodied Agents . Prior to joining Tufts, I was a postdoctoral associate with the Learning Agents Research Group under the supervision of Dr. Peter Stone at the University of Texas at Austin. My work focused on the Building-Wide Intelligence Project which aims to bring robots out of the labs and into human-inhabited environments. While at UT Austin, I was also a Clinical Assistant Professor with the College of Natural Science's Freshman Research Initiative program which aims to enable first year undergraduate students to conduct scientific research.
