The rule-based knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) system Ergo combines reasoning with natural language processing (NLP), databases and ontology systems. Ergo is fully semantic, using general classical-logic-like formulas, including existentials and universal quantifiers, disjunctions, meta knowledge reasoning, higher-order syntax, flexible defeasibility and combines closely with NLP to both interpret and generate English, including potentially for conversational NL interaction. Applications: legal/policy compliance in financial services, health care treatment guidance and insurance, education/tutoring; security/confidentiality policies; and e-commerce marketing Semantic Inferencing on Large Knowledge (SILK): http://silk.semwebcentral.org . A multi-institution project sponsored by Vulcan Inc. ( http://www.vulcan.com ) aiming to provide key knowledge representation infrastructure for global, widely-authored, very large knowledge bases in business and science. OpenRuleBench: http://rulebench.projects.semwebcentral.org . A suite of benchmarks for analyzing the performance and scalability of rule engines for the Semantic Web. Event Transaction Logic Inference System (ETALIS): http://code.google.com/p/etalis . An open source event processing system implemented in Prolog. It is a declarative rule-based language for event processing with various event composition operators, sliding windows, event aggregation, alarms, out-of-order event detection, sharing and so on. Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) - Prolog Bi-directional Translator and Prolog Annotators. UIMA ( http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_projects.nsf/pages/uima.index.html ) is an industrial-strength, scalable and extensible platform for creating, integrating and deploying unstructured information management systems. Its Prolog module allows complete translations of UIMA data structures into Prolog programs and development of UIMA annotators in Prolog. The module was used in the IBM Watson system that played on the Jeopardy! TV quiz show. An optimized interpreter for Tabled Transaction Logic and a performance evaluation suite.
