Constable heads the Nuprl research group in automated reasoning and software verification, and joined the Cornell faculty in 1968. He has supervised over forty PhD students in computer science, including the very first graduate of the CS department. He is known for his work connecting programs and mathematical proofs, which has led to new ways of automating the production of reliable software. He has written three books on this topic as well as numerous research articles. Professor Constable is a graduate of Princeton University where he worked with Alonzo Church, one of the pioneers of computer science. Professor Constable stepped down as the Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Science at Cornell University, serving from 1999 - 2009. CIS is a college-level unit created to advance Cornells academic and research initiative in computing and information science. Professor Constable was formerly chairman of Cornells Computer Science Department for six years.
