Joshua Smith leads the Sensor Systems research group. The group invents new sensor systems, devises new ways to power them, and develops algorithms for using them. The research has application in the domains of robotics, ubiquitous computing, and HCI. Current projects include the battery-free mobile phone, RF-powered cameras, FREE-D (wireless power for Left Ventricular Assist Devices, a type of artificial heart); WARP, extracting power from TV and cell phone towers; and WISP, fully-programmable sensing and computing platforms that are powered by RFID readers. In the area of robotics, the group is working on sensing techniques to support mobile manipulation and Personal Robotics. We have a Willow Garage PR2 robot. We are developing a variety of novel sensors aimed at improving robotic manipulation.
