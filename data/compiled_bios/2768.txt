 Aarti Gupta Professor Department of Computer Science Princeton University 35 Olden Street, Princeton, NJ 08540-5233 Office: 220 Computer Science Phone: +1 609-258-8017 Fax: +1 609-258-1771 Email: aartig (at) cs (dot) princeton (dot) edu My research interests are in formal verification of systems, program analysis, and automatic decision procedures for logics. I am currently serving on the Steering Committee of the International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV). I received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Before joining the CS department at Princeton, I was at NEC Labs America where I led research in systems analysis and verification. At NEC, my group and I designed techniques for verifying programs, and helped in their successful deployment on large industrial software projects. Research Interests Formal verification, model checking, program analysis, logic decision procedures, SAT/SMT solvers Projects SyLVer : Synthesis, Learning, and Verification Instruction Level Abstraction (ILA): in collaboration with Sharad Malik group Minesweeper : in collaboration with Dave Walker and Ryan Beckett Group Graduate Students Weikun (William) Yang Lauren Pick Post-Doctoral Fellows Grigory Fedyukovich Visitor Students Yueling Zhang (ECNU, China) Publications On the DBLP server Teaching Fall 2018: COS IW09 (Independent Work Seminar) -- Programs Generating Programs Spring 2018: COS 598A (Advanced Topics in Computer Science) -- Advances in Verification Fall 2017: COS 516 / ELE 516 -- Automated Reasoning about Software Spring 2017: COS 217 -- Introduction to Programming Systems Fall 2016: COS 516 / ELE 516 -- Automated Reasoning about Software Spring 2016: COS 217 -- Introduction to Programming Systems Fall 2015: COS 597B (Advanced Topics in Computer Science) -- Automated Reasoning about Software Spring 2015: COS 217 -- Introduction to Programming Systems
