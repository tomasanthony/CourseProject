 Lisa Anthony, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Director, Intelligent Natural Interaction Technology (INIT) Laboratory Bio Lisa Anthony is presently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL. She holds a BS and MS in Computer Science (Drexel University, 2002), and a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction (Carnegie Mellon University, 2008). After her Ph.D., Lisa spent two years in a research and development laboratory working on DARPA- and ONR-funded user-centered interface projects at an industry research lab, followed by two years working on multimodal interaction at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. Her current research interests include understanding how children can make use of advanced interaction techniques and how to develop technology to support them in a variety of contexts, including education, health care and serious games. She has received funding from industry and government sources, including the prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER award. Her Ph.D. dissertation investigated the use of handwriting input for middle school math tutoring software, and her simple and accurate multistroke gesture recognizers called $N and $P are well-known in the field of interactive surface gesture recognition. Her work has been recognized by the research community with three best paper awards, including one in 2013 at the top HCI conference, the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI).
