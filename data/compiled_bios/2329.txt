I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Princeton University. My Advisor was Prof. Perry Cook . I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) with Prof. Jodi Forlizzi , and before that a research fellow with Prof. Zhenhui (Jack) Jiang in the National University of Singapore (NUS) in the Information Systems department . Before joining HKUST, I was a researcher of Human-Computer Interaction at Noah's Ark Lab , Huawei Tech. Investment Co., Ltd. in Hong Kong. The HCI group @ HKUST designs and creates novel technologies, methods, and theories in the area of Human-Computer Interaction and Affective Computing . We welcome graduate students, post-docs, and visiting interns/scholars. Please send me your CV if your are interested in this topic or have any question . My research interest is data-driven approaches to Human-Engaged Computing ( Read more ) . We explore how to promote human's attentional, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral engagement when interacting with computing systems: (i) Inference: sensing and modeling human engagement dynamicity (a) Social signals (b) Physiological signals (c) Behavioral signals (ii) Analytics: mining engaging factors from online and offline activities in everyday life (a) Engagement with physical and virtual entities (b) Engagement with social actors and collective activities (iii) Application I with AI systems: machine intelligence for more engaging human-robot/agent interactions (a) Emotionally and socially intelligent AI (b) Engaging multi-party Human-AI collaboration (iv) Application II with non-AI entities: hybrid realities for more engaging human-data/object interactions (a) Informatics (b) Narratives and communication (c) Persuasion and recommendation Courses TOP COMP3711 (UG Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Spring 2018 ) COMP4461 (UG HCI, Fall 2017 , Fall 2018 ) COMP4901G (UG Hot Topics in HCI, Spring 2016 , Fall 2016 ) COMP6613A (PG Hot Topics in HCI, Fall 2015 , Spring 2017 ) IELM4320 (Design Thinking, Summer 2016 , Summer 2017 ) Selected Publications ALL TOP Journal Wang, L., Geng, X., Ke, J., Peng, C., Ma, X., Zhang, D., and Yang, Q.
