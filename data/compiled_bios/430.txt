Ying He Associate Professor School of Computer Engineering Nanyang Technological University Office: N4-02a-22 Tel: +65 6514 1008 Email: yhe `at' ntu.edu.sg Research Interests My research interests fall into the general areas of visual computing. I'm particularly interested in the problems which require geometric analysis and computation. I have applied geometric approaches to a wide spectrum of engineering fields, including computer graphics, computer-aided design, multimedia, wireless sensor networking, and medical imaging.
