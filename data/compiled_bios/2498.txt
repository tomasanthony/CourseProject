If you are interested, please apply department graduate program and send me email including your resume. Biography I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Oklahoma State University . My research interests are broadly in data mining and machine learning using large-scale datasets. Specifically, my recent work focuses on graph mining and social network analysis, applied machine learning. I got my Phd in the Computer Science from Florida State University in 2017 under the guidance of Dr. Peixiang Zhao on community detection and search problems. I recieved my MS in 2010 from Bilkent University under the guidance of Dr. Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu on the aspect based opinion mining on Turkish tweets.
