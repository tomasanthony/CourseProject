 Greg Lowry Walter J. Blenko, Sr. Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering Contact 123E Porter Hall Email 412-268-2948 412-268-7813 Address Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 Bio Greg Lowry is a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. His area of teaching and research is environmental engineering and water quality with specialization in environmental nanotechnology, geochemistry, contaminant fate, and remediation. He is the Deputy Director of the National Science Foundations Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEINT). CEINT aims to better understand the behavior and effects of engineered nanomaterials in complex environmental systems. Professor Lowry is a member of the National Research Council's committee to develop a research strategy for environmental health and safety aspects of engineered nanomaterials. He currently serves on the advisory board for the Duke Superfund Basic Research Center, NanoRem and NanoEau II (EC projects). Education Ph.D. 2000 - Stanford University M.S. 1995 - University of Wisconsin, Madison B.S. 1992 - University of California, Davis Research Research Group: EESS Research Center: CEINT Areas of Interest Environmental nanotechnology, energy and environment, and environmental remediation. Specific areas of interest include characterizing and modeling biogeochemical transformations of nanoparticles, interactions of nanoparticles with organic macromolecules, nanoparticle reactivity, fate of organic contaminants in CO2 sequestration and hydraulic fracturing environments, developing and testing groundwater and soil remediation technologies.
