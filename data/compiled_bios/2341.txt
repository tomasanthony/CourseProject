 Kenneth Wai-Ting LEUNG Visiting Assistant Professor (PhD, HKUST, 2010) Home | HKUST | CSE Department Biography I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology . I received my M.Sc. (2004) and Ph.D. (2010) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , and my B.Sc. (2002) degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia , Canada. A copy of my CV is available here in pdf format. Research Interests My research interests lie in the area of information retrieval and mobile data management . The major aim of my research is to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval systems so that relevant information can be easily discovered by the users. More specifically, I am interested in the following research topics: Personalized Web Search Social Information Retrieval Mobile Information Retrieval Privacy Preserving Information Retrieval Web Knowledge Acquisition Location-Based Services Clickthrough Clustering References 10 Papers on Personalized Web Search What Personalization Means to Search Google Personalized Search - Youtube Google Search Privacy: Personalized Search - Youtube Nexus One Search - Youtube Google Local Search - Youtube Privacy and Personalization: From Clickstream to Targeted Advertising The Importance of Mobile Local Search Lee, D.L., User Profiling and Personalized Information Delivery on the Static and Mobile Web , Proceedings of the CIKM 2010 Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM) , 2010.
