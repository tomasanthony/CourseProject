 Xiao-Wen CHANG Publications Software Students Seminars Laboratory Contact Teaching COMP 350 Fall Numerical Computing COMP 540 Fall Matrix Computations COMP 642 Winter Numerical Estimation Welcome! My research interests are in the field of scientific computing, with particular emphasis on numerical linear algebra and optimization and their applications. Currently I am mainly interested in designing, analyzing and implementing effective computer algorithms for parameter estimation problems such as real least squares, integer least squares, robust estimation, and partially linear model estimation etc, and as well as their applications in machine learning, communications, signal processing, control, localization in wireless sensor networks and GNSS based positioning. I am also interested in lattice reduction, which has applications in integer programming, cryptanalysis and computer algebra.
