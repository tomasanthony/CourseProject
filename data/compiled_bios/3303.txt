 CS&E Profile: Carl Sturtivant About I teach mainly discrete mathematics, algorithms & data structures, automata theory, computability, complexity theory at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and also internet & network programming as well as beginning programming in various languages. I also supervise some independent study and undergraduate projects. Additionally I coach the intercollegiate programming contest teams for the regional (and occasionally world final) contest. Here are some of the classes I teach from time-to-time. On the strength of teaching these classes I have been repeatedly voted Best Computer Science Professor by College of Science and Engineering students.
