My name is Bruno. I am a software engineering enthusiast and passionate to my family and to make software development an even better activity. I'm from Salvador (Brazil), the capital of the Bahia state (northeast of the Brazilian beautiful coast). Now I live in another beautiful coastal area but turned to the Pacific ocean. In August 2017, I moved to the wonderful town of San Luis Obispo-CA, joining the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department at Cal Poly (California Polytechnic State University) . I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) and a M.Sc. degree in the same field from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), both in Brazil. At Cal Poly, I work as an Assistant Professor in the Software Engineering field. Don't hesitate to drop me a line if you want to discuss any stuff related to the content of this website, software engineering, Cal Poly, or whatever you think would be interesting to discuss with me. bcdasilv (at) calpoly (dot) edu Google schoolar profile Software evolution visualization tool with augmented reality.
