 James H. Garrett, Jr., P.E. Dean, College of Engineering Contact 110 Scaife Hall Email 412-268-5090 Address College of Engineering Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Bio James H. Garrett, Jr. was appointed Dean of the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 2013. He also holds the Thomas Lord Professorship of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Prior to becoming Dean, Garrett was Head of Carnegie Mellons Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from June 2006 to December 2012. Garrett is a licensed professional engineer in Texas. He is a founding co-director of the Smart Infrastructure Institute (formerly the Pennsylvania Smarter Infrastructure Incubator), a research center aimed at creating and evaluating sensing, data analytics and intelligent decision support for improving the construction, management and operation of infrastructure systems. Garrett served as Co-Chief Editor of the ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering from 2008-2013. Garretts research and teaching interests are oriented toward applications of sensors and sensor systems to civil infrastructure condition assessment; application of data mining and machine learning techniques for infrastructure management problems in civil and environmental engineering; mobile hardware/software systems for field applications; representations and processing strategies to support the usage of engineering codes, standards, and specifications; knowledge-based decision support systems. Garrett has published over 250 journal articles, conference papers, and monograph/book chapters related to his research.
