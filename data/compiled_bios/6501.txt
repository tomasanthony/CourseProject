(EECS), MIT, 1982 Biography Papers Research Students Welcome to my home page! I am a professor in the CSE department at UCSD, having been on the faculty since 1987. My research is in operating systems, distributed systems and networks, broadly focusing on performance, reliability and security of Internet-scale systems with highly decentralized control. I primarily teach our core classes on Principles of Operating Systems (at both the undergraduate upper divison and graduate levels). During summers, I lead a summer study-abroad program in Rome, Italy, titled "Mathematical Beauty in Rome," where we study the architectural geometry and structural engineering of classical Roman monuments. Research areas and topics Areas: operating systems, distributed systems and networks Current topics: cloud computing, peer-to-peer systems, thin-client computing Past topics: long-running replicated systems, network-based I/O, I/O system software, extended client/server structures, mobile agents, packet scheduling for network QoS, OS/network support for multimedia (audio and video), TCP/IP performance, file system I/O performance, multicast routing Courses CSE 20: Discrete Mathematics CSE 21: Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems CSE 120: Principles of Operating Systems CSE 121: Operating Systems: Architecture and Implementation CSE 122: Operating Systems Laboratory CSE 221: Graduate Operating Systems Freshman Seminars CSE 87: The Science of Casino Games CSE 87: The Slide Rule: History, Theory, and Practice CSE 87: Freshman Seminar on Engineering the Roman Empire Senior Seminars CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Advanced Slide Rule CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Exploring Operating Systems CSE 192: Senior Seminar on Engineering the Roman Empire Global Seminar (Summer Study Abroad) CSE 4GS: Mathematical Beauty in Rome CSE 6GS: Mathematical Laboratory in Rome Affiliations UCSD CSE Systems and Networking Group UCSD Center for Networked Systems UCSD Center for Wireless Communications Cal-IT2: California Institute for Telecommuncations and Information Technology COSMOS: Cal Summer School for Math/Science ( promo video , 2007 , 2006 , 2005 ) Miscellaneous NPR article on slide rules that mentions UCSD's Slide Rule Seminar Why Does A Slide Rule Work? , 2014 Oughtred Society conference in Las Vegas.

The real University, [Phaedrus] said, has no specific location. It owns no property, pays no salaries and receives no material dues. The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location. It's a state of mind which is regenerated throughout the centuries by a body of people who traditionally carry the title of professor, but even that title is not part of the real University. The real University is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself. from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , by Robert Pirsig ______________ _______
