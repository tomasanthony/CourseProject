 Dr. Rico Sennrich Lecturer (Assistant Professor) School of Informatics, room 3.03A 10 Crichton Street Edinburgh, EH8 9AB, United Kingdom rico.sennrich AT ed.ac.uk Main CV Publications Teaching Students Software and Data I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Edinburgh working on machine learning, especially in the area of machine translation and natural language processing. My recent focus has been high-quality machine translation, with syntax-based SMT , and with neural machine translation . Some of our results can be found in my publications , and in the results of the WMT shared translation tasks ( 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 ). I am a member of the Machine Translation Group and the Edinburgh NLP Group - come join our weekly meetings. I am also affiliated with the University of Zurich in the CoNTra project. News 2018: I have two funded PhD studentships at the University of Zurich (start: September 2019; application deadline: 20 January 2019): more information here . 2018: I received a SNSF Professorship and will move to the University of Zurich in August 2019. 2018: congratulations to Jonathan Mallinson, Gongbo Tang, Samuel Lubli, and all co-authors: 3 papers accepted to EMNLP 2018. 2018: congratulations to Elena Voita; her paper on anaphora resolution in discourse-level MT has been accepted to ACL. 2018: congratulations to Rachel Bawden; her paper on discourse-level MT has been accepted to NAACL. 2017: I have been appointed Lecturer in Machine Learning at the University of Edinburgh. 2017: congratulation to my co-authors: 2 short papers accepted to EMNLP; 3 research papers to WMT. Camera-ready versions coming soon. 2017: UEDIN is tied for best constrained system for 11 out of 12 translation pairs in which we participated in the WMT17 shared news translation task. 2016: how grammatical is character-level neural MT? Difficult question, but we can test this with contrastive translation pairs (EACL 2017). The test set is released here . 2016: update: now all our WMT16 neural systems are available here . 2016: new textbook: Philip Williams, Rico Sennrich, Matt Post and Philipp Koehn. Syntax-based Statistical Machine Translation 2016: Edinburgh submitted neural MT systems to the WMT 16 shared translation task for 8 translation directions, which are ranked (tied) best for 7 out of 8.
