I am an Assistant Professor and Director of the Team Research Analytics in Computational Environments (TRACE) Research Group within thedivision of Human-Centered Computing in the School of Computing atClemson University . I also hold anaffiliationin ClemsonsHuman Factors Institute . In addition, I am a Faculty Scholar in Clemsons School of Health Research and a Watt Family Faculty Fellow . I received my PhD in Information Sciences & Technology with a focus on Team Decision Making, Cognition, and Computer SupportedCollaborativeWork from The Pennsylvania State University in the fall of 2014 with Madhu Reddy (now at Northwestern) as myadvisor.After graduation, I accepted a position to be a Postdoctoral Scholar and Research Associate in Human Systems Engineering at Arizona State University working directly with Nancy Cooke . My research interests are wide ranging and interdisciplinary, but can be generally linked to the integration of teamwork and technology in: -Human Factors -Human Computer Interaction -Artificial Intelligence -C omputer Supported Cooperative Work -Information Sciences For over 10 years, I have conducted research mainly focused on teamwork and collaborativetechnology within a variety of different contexts. My current research interests span acrossthe study of better understanding the relationship of team cognition and technology,human-machine teaming, and the development/design of human-centered collaborative tools and systems. Specific contexts that I have conducted my research in: healthcare systems, homeland security, command andcontrol, and emergency crisis management . Throughout all of my research, Itypically use multiple mixed methods to understand the context, work, and roles specific to the development of individual and team cognition. I currently serve on multiple international/societal program and technical committees, in addition to multiple editorial boards including Human Factors. As a result of my work, my research has been published in peer-reviewed venues over 50 times and I have acquired over $8M in research funding . Research Interests & Expertise: Human factors, team decision-making, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, computer-supported cooperative work, team cognition, cognitive science, usability research and design, collaborative system design, human-centered design, team mental models, mental models, collaboration, collaborative information seeking, cognitive task analysis, knowledge elicitation, human autonomy teaming, healthcare systems, big data, simulations, cybersecurity Research Methods: A/B testing, card sorting, cognitive walkthrough, concept mapping, contextual inquiry, ethnography, experimental design, focus groups, heuristic evaluation, interviewing, personas, prototyping, scenarios, surveying, task analysis, usability testing, wireframing News (Assuming I Routinely Update This) 2-5. TRACE Research Group received a grant of $26k to fund a 3 week session of TRACE Programming Bootcamp . This is a programming camp focused on web development and will greatly help students at Clemson (across all Colleges) articulate their technical skills. 2.4. Paper accepted to 2019 Cogsima 1.15. Our $3M NSF NRT Program THINKER has started. We are actively looking for graduate students interested in this opportunity. The effort generally focuses on human-centered design and smart manufacturing. 1.11. Paper presented at HICSS. 11.19 Paper accepted to 2019 iConference.
