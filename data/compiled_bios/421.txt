Hence, please rephrase your message (or change subject) and try again. However, please note that my emails are organized in threads and I tend to read them in FIFO order so, if you send too many reminders, your email keeps being pushed up and never being read. follow SenticNet on Series IEEE IS ACSA ICDM SENTIRE KDD WISDOM Sentic Seminar S3A Meeting Special Issues SMMFF @ IPM DSSM @ FGCS CIACSA @ IEEE CIM AffReason @ TAC CI4BigData @ CIM KBNLP @ KBS Learning @ CIM ESSEM @ IPM SocialData @ KBS AffCog @ NeuNet CINLP @ IEEE CIM SACLSA @ IEEE IS KBCLSA @ IEEE IS In the News Forbes DataInnovation KDnuggets SingularityHub DMNews OpenGov Datanami Bibliometrics Piryani et al.
