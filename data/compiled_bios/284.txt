Babu, PhD Hello, welcome to my home page! I am an Associate Professor in the Division of Human-Centered Computing in the School of Computing at Clemson University . I co-direct the virtual environments group with research projects involving spatial perception in virtual environments, scenario design and behavior modeling for virtual agents in interactive simulations, virtual reality based training and education in the mechanical and medical domains. My Google Scholar Profile is Here . My research interests are broadly in the areas of Virtual Environments, 3D Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Humans, and Embodied Agents. I have also conducted research in the use of virtual reality in the therapy of balance disorders, travel and locomotion in virtual environments, applied perception and cognition in virtual reality, computer vision, and visualization. Prior to joining Clemson University, I served as a Assistant Research Scientist and Post-Doctoral Fellow (2007 to 2010) in the Hank Virtual Environments Lab at the University of Iowa . I earned my PhD (May 2007) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte . I also hold an MS degree in Informatics (May 2002) and a BS degree in Biology (May 2000) from UNC-Charlotte. I was the General Chair for the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference 2016 . My fellow Co-Chairs were Dr. Larry F. Hodges and Dr. Zachary Wartell . I am now serving as a Program Chair for the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference 2017 .
