 Fahad's Homepage Fahad Rafique Dogar Assistant Professor, Computer Science Dept. Senior Fellow for Civic Technology, Tisch College Tufts University Email: fahad@cs.tufts.edu I am an assistant professor in the computer science department at Tufts University. My research interests span networking and distributed systems. My current interests include cloud and mobile systems, wide area networking, and future Internet architectures. My students and I are part of the NAT (Networking At Tufts) group. Earlier, I completed my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, a post-doc from Microsoft Research, UK, and undergrad from LUMS. I was also a visiting professor at LUMS in Fall 2011. Note for Tufts undergrads: If you are interested in doing research with me, please shoot me an email. I have ongoing projects in mobile computing, cloud and data center networking, and Internet architecture and protocols.
