Masse Assistant Office: Pierce Hall 118 Assistant Phone: (617) 495-4202 Research Mgr: Stacia Zatsiorsky : Profile Marko Lonar's research focuses on phenomena resulting from the interaction of light and matter on a nano-scale level. These phenomena include efficient light confinement and emission within photonic crystals, light generation in engineered semiconductors (e.g. nanowires, quantum dots, quantum cascade lasers), manipulation of nano-scale objects using guided waves. He is interested in development of functional nano-photonic devices, and their integration into systems, that can be used for optical communication and optical signal processiong, life sciences and quantum optics. Particular areas of interest include: Periodic optical structures: e.g. photonic crystal devices, metamaterials and metalo-dielectric structures in general Classical and and non-classical light sources based on nanostructures Plasmonics Nanofabrication techniques Nanoscale electro-mechanical (NEMS) and opto-mechanical (NOMS) devices and systems Application of nanophotonics in life sciences (e.g. bio-chemical sensors) Mid-infrared and far-infrared devices and systems, including quantum cascade lasers
