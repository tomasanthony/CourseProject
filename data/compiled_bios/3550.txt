Biography Chunlei Liu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. He received a B.S. in Physics from Peking University, a M.S. in Physics from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. Before joining UC Berkeley, he was an Associate Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. His current research interests are brain imaging and modulation. He develops MRI and signal processing techniques to study brain structure and function. His group also works on technologies for remote modulation of neuronal activities. He received NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99) in 2006, ISMRM Young Investigator Award finalist in 2007 and RSNA Margulis Award in 2015. .
