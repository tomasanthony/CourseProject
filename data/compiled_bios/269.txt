 I am the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) and a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, on-line learning algorithms, concept drift, and applications of machine learning and data mining to computer security. I led the effort that established Georgetown's first graduate programs in computer science and served as their first director. In 2004, I shared with Zico Kolter the award for the best application paper at KDD for our work on detecting malicious executables. In 2007, I shared with Greg Stephens and Kate Arndt a Program Innovation Award from the MITRE Corporation for our work on detecting insider threats. I have served as a consultant to industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. I teach the department's courses on machine learning (COSC-288, COSC-575) and artificial intelligence (COSC-270, COSC-574). I have also taught the department's introductory courses, Computer ScienceI (COSC-051), Computer ScienceII (COSC-052), and Data Structures (COSC-160). In the spring, I'm teaching Office hours, 325 STM: TR 12:001:30 PM (or by appointment). For fun, I play a little guitar and do a little sailing. I'm always in search of great sushi. Lately, the best has been at umi in San Francisco. October 19, 2015: Handout for my talk for Philosophy and Star Trek (PHIL-180). September 30, 2015: Handout for my talk for Governing Emerging Technologies (CCTP-779). October 20, 2014: Handout for my talk for Philosophy and Star Trek (PHIL-180). September 15, 2013: For my part of the ITEL project "Improving Computer Science I" with Clay Shields, I created and uploaded a series of video lectures and screencasts to YouTube on object-oriented design and classes, C++ vectors, pointers, and self-referential classes. We also released the code developed in the videos. February 26, 2013: Everyone should learn how to code. "...software is really about humanity...it's really about helping people..." September 18, 2012: Handout for my talk at the 2012 Heilbronn Annual Conference. December 9, 2010: Paper with Stephen Bach (now at UMD) on a Bayesian approach to concept drift appears at NIPS 2010. March 2, 2010: Stephen Bach (C '10) is one of two undergraduates in the department selected as a Computing Research Association Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award Winners. Details... December 8, 2009: Paper (with Deanna Caputo and Greg Stephens) on insider threat appears in IEEE Security & Privacy. December 15, 2008: Stephen Bach (C '10) presents Paired learners for concept drift at ICDM in Pisa, Italy. December 31, 2007: Journal of Machine Learning Research publishes Dynamic Weighted Majority: An ensemble method for drifting concepts (with Zico Kolter). August 25, 2005: Springer publishes Machine Learning and Data Mining for Computer Security. Copyright 2019 Mark Maloof. All Rights Reserved.
