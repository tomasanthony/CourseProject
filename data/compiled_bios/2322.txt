Here is a brief summary of my research statement to summarize some of my research topics with their contributions and impacts. 1. Knowledge Discovery Applications of Data Mining During my master degree, I focused on studying the "utility" of data mining. Most traditional data mining techniques find many different "patterns". For example, association rules and clustering are typical patterns in data mining. However, these patterns cannot directly be used for decision making which is the main objective of data mining. The focus of my research work about knowledge discovery is how to utilize these kinds of traditional patterns in data mining. More specifically, in my work published in ICDM03, association rule mining which are studied extensively in the literature of data mining aims at understanding the relationship among items in a basket analysis. The focus of our work is to find a set of items in order to maximize the profit of the company with the use of the traditional patterns in applications of inventory control and marketing. The concept of the "utility" of data mining gives a lot of opportunities to researchers to work on many new problems which utilize the traditional data mining patterns. Data Streams After I graduated my master degree, I continued working on top-K itemsets mining over data streams and published papers in Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. In the literature of data mining, association rule mining is very popular because of the ease of understanding the relationship among items. However, it suffers from a major drawback of setting a "magic" number of the user-defined threshold which is used to determine whether an association rule is "interesting" or not. Setting this magic number depends on the characteristics of data. Setting too high gives no association rules at all but setting too low gives abundant association rules. Setting a reasonable threshold is troublesome because it may involve a lot of steps for "trying". These "trying" steps can only be used in the static data but they cannot be used over data streams because, in data streams, all data can be read once only and cannot be read back again. From the perspective of human, the number of "interesting" association rules should be roughly equal to a certain size K given by the users. In this way, the users can just give a parameter K and K "interesting" association rules can be returned as desired. My work focuses on mining top-K association rules (or simply frequent patterns) over data streams. It is different from all "magic" number dependent techniques about association rule mining over data streams. The utilization of "top-K" is not only meaningful to human but also useful with data streams where the data characteristics are unknown. 2. Database Queries Skyline Queries One of my recent research works published in KDD07 is skyline queries. All traditional skyline queries are based on totally-ordered numeric attributes. However, in many existing applications, there are some categorical attributes in which the ordering or preference of values is different with different users. For example, when we select air flights, some categorical attributes are airline and transition airport. Due to the inability of the existing techniques to solve this new problem, we propose some methods to handle it. Since our proposed problem is much general than the traditional problems, all variations of the traditional problems such as finding skyline over data streams and find skyline with respect to any subspace can be some of the potential research problems when categorical attributes are considered. Spatial Matching Queries In my recent work published in VLDB07, I proposed a spatial matching problem which is a general problem of an extensively studied problem in the literature of spatial database, reverse nearest neighbor. My major contribution in this paper is that this work brings the researchers an attention to consider the maximum serving capacity of each service in all customer-service applications which are not considered in all existing works related to reverse nearest neighbor. We prove that our spatial matching problem is a general problem of (bichromatic) reverse nearest neighbor. Thus, all existing works related to reverse nearest neighbors can also be extended with the consideration of the capacities of services. Some examples are finding reverse nearest neighbors in real time and finding reverse nearest neighbors of moving objects with the consideration of the capacities. 3. Privacy Issues One of my research topics is privacy. Publishing sensitive data is an important topic in the literature of privacy. The major task of data publishing is to release data which can protect individual privacy. At the same time, the "utility" of the released data can be kept as high as possible and thus the "distortion" or "information loss" of the released data should be minimized. My recent work published in VLDB07 points out that individual privacy breaches when the minimality principle is used in the anonymization. Since all existing works rely on this principle, all published tables defined by the existing works suffer from privacy breaches. Thus, since all existing works are affected, their works should be re-done with the consideration of the minimality principle during data publishing in order to protect individual privacy.
