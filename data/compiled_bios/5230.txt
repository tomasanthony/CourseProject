 Education PhD in Computer Science, Indiana University MS in Computer Science, Indiana University BS in Computer Science and Philosophy, BA in History, Trinity University Biography Jason Hemanns research interests include functional and logic programming. He focuses on embeddings and extensions to support logic programming in numerous host languages and transforming functional programs to relational ones. His microKanren model has inspired scores of implementationsmore than 120, in over 40 host languages, in just five years. Jasons other interests concern novel uses of logic programming and symbolic constraint systems and typesafe embeddings of logic languages. Jasons research interests blend together with his teaching. His research questions tend to emerge from his teaching, and his results make it back into the classroom. An example of this approach can be found in his recently published textbook The Reasoned Schemer, 2nd Edition. He has been teaching in various capacities for over 15 years, including pre-college STEM programs, private professional training programs, and university courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. His awards include Associate Instructor of the Year at Indiana University. Prior to joining Northeastern, Jason was briefly a Visiting Faculty at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Jason earned his Ph.D. in 2018 from the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University as part of the programming languages research community and under the supervision of Dan Friedman. He earned his M.S in Computer Science from the School of Informatics and Computing at IU, and both a B.S. in Computer Science and Philosophy and a B.A. in History at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. :
