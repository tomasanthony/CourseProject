Xiaorui  Sun Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Contact Building & Room: 1241 SEO Office Phone Voice: (312) 996-3476 Email: xiaorui@uic.edu Related Sites: View full profile About I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Chicago. Prior to joining UIC, I was at UC Berkeley Simons Institute and Microsoft Research. I recieved my Ph.D. in 2016 from Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Xi Chen. My research is in theoretical computer science. More specifically, I work in parallel algorithms, sublinear algorithms and graph algorithms. Research Interests: Design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on big data processing, including algorithmic graph theory, massively parallel computing and machine learning theory Selected Publications The Query Complexity of Graph Isomorphism: Bypassing Distribution Testing Lower Bounds Krzysztof Onak , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2018 Probability-Revealing Samples Krzysztof Onak , Xiaorui Sun AISTATS 2018 Linear Regression Without Correspondence Daniel Hsu, Kevin Shi, Xiaorui Sun NIPS 2017 Correspondence retrieval Alexandr Andoni, Daniel Hsu, Kevin Shi, Xiaorui Sun COLT 2017 Efficient Massively Parallel Methods for Dynamic Programming Sungjin Im , Benjamin Moseley , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2017 Faster Canonical Forms for Primitive Coherent Configurations [arxiv] Xiaorui Sun, John Wilmes STOC 2015 Invited to the SIAM Journal on Computing Special Issue On the Complexity of Optimal Lottery Pricing and Randomized Mechanisms Xi Chen , Ilias Diakonikolas , Anthi Orfanou , Dimitris Paparas , Xiaorui Sun, Mihalis Yannakakis FOCS 2015 Near-Optimal Density Estimation in Near-Linear Time Using Variable-Width Histograms [nips] Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco Servedio , Xiaorui Sun NIPS 2014 Efficient Density Estimation via Piecewise Polynomial Approximation [arxiv] Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco Servedio , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2014 Blog post about this work: MIT theory student blog A Composition Theorem for Parity Kill Number [arxiv] Ryan ODonnell , Xiaorui Sun, Li-Yang Tan , John Wright , Yu Zhao CCC 2014 The Complexity of Optimal Multidimensional Pricing [arxiv] Xi Chen , Ilias Diakonikolas , Dimitris Paparas , Xiaorui Sun, Mihalis Yannakakis SODA 2014 Faster Canonical Forms For Strongly Regular Graphs [pdf] Lszl Babai , Xi Chen , Xiaorui Sun, Shang-Hua Teng , John Wilmes FOCS 2013 Invited to the SIAM Journal on Computing Special Issue Multi-Stage Propagation and Quasipolynomial-Time Isomorphism Testing of Steiner 2-System Xi Chen , Xiaorui Sun, Shang-Hua Teng STOC 2013 Learning Mixtures of Structured Distributions over Discrete Domains [arxiv] Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco A.
