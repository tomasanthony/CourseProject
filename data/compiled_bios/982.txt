 Rudi Mathon 40 St George Street Bahen Centre for Information Technology, Room BA4232 University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 2E4 Phone (416)-978-4391 <font face="Verdana" ,"arial","san="" serif";="" size="2"> Fax (416) 978-1931 Biography Rudi Mathon received his first degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Prague in 1962. His MSc and PhD in Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1972 are in the area of numerical analysis of partial differential equations. He is full professor in the Department of Computer Science since 1982. His research interests are in the area of analysis and design of algorithms for numerical and combinatorial problems. Much of his recent research deals with combinatorial design theory and its application to various areas of Computer Science. He is working on new search techniques for large combinatorial optimization problems which utilize the structure, symmetry and various algebraic properties. He is also on the editorial boards of Journal of Combinatorial Designs and Australasian Journal of Combinatorics. Selected Publications T. Hull and R.
