Jones I'm a Reader at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory and hold an EPSRC early career fellowship. I'm also a Fellow and 1956 College Lecturer at Gonville and Caius college where I'm joint Director of Studies (DoS) for Computer Science. My research focuses on extracting the many different forms of parallelism from applications (e.g. thread-level, data-level, memory-level) to increase performance and address energy-efficiency and reliability challenges within compilers, binary translators and microarchitectures. I'm increasingly looking into security implications too. I occasionally blog about my group's activities and research and you can find me on Twitter with the handle TJonesCL . I have an Erds Number of 4, apparently.
