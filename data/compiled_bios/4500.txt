Peania or Paiania): snapshots from my desk and my desktop, apparently spanning three millenia. (1)In the antiquity Paeania was a ``demos'' (meaning group of people, same root as ``democracy'') belonging to the larger urban area of Athens. Here are some references: Plato , with some more text . Aristotle , and more text . Pausanias . (2)Here are some pictures taken between 1939 and 1944. (3)Today in Paeania there is major telecommunications and software industry, namely Intracom and the Athens Information Technology Research Center , the Alpha , Antenna and Mega TV channels, the Panathinaikos sports club, and, most recently, the new Athens International Airport . One can also visit the Vorres Museum (which used to have a Web site but apparently not anymore), and an Ornamental Stone Laboratory . Here the Wikipedia information for Paeania. Here is Paeania's own web site (in Greek) . 2138 Klaus Building 266 Ferst Drive Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0765 Phone: 404-385-0617 mailto:mihail@cc.gatech.edu
