Contact: Professor Scott Dunham, ECE Dept., Univ. of Washington UW Nanotechnology Modeling Laboratory The Nanotechnology Modeling Lab at the University of Washington is part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in the College of Engineering . The efforts within the Lab are focused on obtaining basic understanding of nanofabrication processes and device operation, applying that knowledge to produce better models, simulators and devices. For more information on recent activities see our project descriptions and publications , as well as the activities of the students working in the lab. Research within the Lab includes model development for process simulation, application of a wide range of simulation and modeling tools for device design and optimization, and experimental studies of device fabrication. The Lab is associated with the Institute for Nano-engineered Systems , the Clean Energy Institute , and the Molecular Engineering Materials Center (MEM-C) at UW. Experimental work is conducted in UW's NNCI Washington Nanofabrication Facility (WNF) and Molecular Analysis Facility (MAF) , and in collaboration with partners from academic, industry and government research labs.
