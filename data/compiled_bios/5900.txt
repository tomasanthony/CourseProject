["Professor of Electrical Engineering-Systems and Biomedical EngineeringEducationDoctoral Degree, Electrical Engineering, Stanford UniversityMaster's Degree, Electrical Engineering, Stanford UniversityBachelor's Degree, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics, Florida State University BiographyKrishna Nayak is a Professor of Electrical Engineering with joint appointments in Radiology and Biomedical Engineering.  Prof. Nayak received a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2001, an MS in Electrical Engineering from Stanford in 1996, and BS degrees in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics from Florida State University in 1995. Research SummaryMy lab's research mission is to develop and clinically translate novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. Our contributions to date have included new MRI pulse sequence designs, data sampling and image reconstruction techniques, and artifact mitigation techniques.  We have a diverse portfolio of projects that currently includes new tools for cardiac stress testing, obstructive sleep apnea assessment, brain tumor evaluation, and the study of normal and abnormal speech production.   The common theme is the development of rapid and quantitative MRI techniques, and to work closely with experts from other disciplines to translate and validate this technology. We have a long track record of collaboration with cardiologists, radiologists, pulmonologists, obesity researchers, otolaryngologists, endocrinologists, linguists, and MRI technicians.Awards2018 Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) Fellow2017 American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) Fellow2014 USC Community Engagement Award2013 USC Center for Excellence in Teaching Faculty Fellow2011 National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering Education, Symposium Participant2009 GE Healthcare Magnetic Resonance (MR) Thought Leader Award2008 USC Mentoring Award, Faculty Mentoring Graduate Students2007 USC Viterbi School of Engineering Junior Faculty Research Award2001 Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Hertz Foundation Doctoral Thesis Prize1995 Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowship1995 Phi Kappa Phi Phi Kappa Phi Graduate Fellowship1995 Tau Beta Pi Tau Beta Pi Centennial Fellowship #111993 Phi Beta Kappa Member1993 Phi Kappa Phi Member1993 Tau Beta Pi MemberAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - SystemsBiomedical Engineering OfficeEEB 406Hughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2564 Contact Information(213) 740-3494knayak@usc.eduWebsitesCV LinkResearch WebsitePersonal WebsitePublications"]
