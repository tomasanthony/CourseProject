 I am a professor in the Computer and Information Systems (CIS) department at Temple University, Philadelphia and director of the Temple site of the NSF IUCRC called CRIS (Center for Research in Intelligent Storage). Prior to this I was with Center for Secure Information Systems ( CSIS) at George Mason University, Fairfax, VA and serving as a program director in the Computer and Networks Systems (CNS) division cluster of CISE/CNS division from 2008-2013 . Prior to this, I worked for Intel Corporation on future server architectures and technologies. My recent research interests include the following: Sustainability and energy issues in data center design. Synergies between computer and logistics networks Storage systems performance and robustness Cloud computing and configuration management security Resilience and performance in high performance computing Communications for disaster management Smart grid security I can be reached via phone at (215) 204-9654 and by email at kkant at temple.edu. Krishna Kant IEEE Fellow My other areas with significant expertise and prior/ongoing work include (a) Traffic characterization of internet and e-commerce servers, (b) Detailed platform level performance modeling, (c) Network acceleration at transport and higher layers, (d) compression technologies, and (e) peer to peer computing. Prior to joining Intel, I was with Bellcore (now Telcordia) from 1992 to 1997 where I worked on a both Operations support and Switching sides of Telecom. In particular, I worked on a variety of aspects related to Signaling System no 7 (SS7) including SS7 congestion control , link error monitoring, capacity planning and personal communications technologies. Prior to Bellcore , I was an associate professor of computer science at Penn State University (1985-1991) primarily working in areas of performance modeling and distributed systems. From 1981-1985, I was an assistant professor in the EECS department, Northwestern University, working mainly in the areas of fault-tolerance and performance modeling . In 1992, I published a graduate level textbook on performance modeling, titled Introduction to Computer Systems Performance Modeling , McGraw Hill, 1992. I was elected a fellow of the IEEE for contributions to enterprise server performance and power management technologies and Domain Name System Robustness. At NSF, I represented the CISE directorate in driving the large Sustainability initiative called SEES (Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability) from its inception in 2010 until 2013, including the many funding programs that it produced. In 2012 I received directors award for my contributions to SEES. Available Positions: I am looking for Ph.D. students and postdocs in multiple areas, but particularly in storage systems, data center energy management, and smart grid security.
