 Vijaya Ramachandran Blakemore Regents Professor of Computer Science The University of Texas at Austin Ph.D. Princeton University Research Interests My research interests are in algorithms and computational theory , primarily in the areas of graph algorithms, data structures, randomized algorithms, parallel algorithms and effective models for computation. The main focus of my current research is on designing efficient algorithms for the multicore computing environment. You can access copies of recent papers of mine. A complete listing of my publications is available in my vita. [ vita in Adobe pdf ] Research Opportunities Current Graduate students: Contact me if you are interested in a CS395 independent research course with me. Prospective graduate students: Instructions and online application link can be found at the department's graduate admissions website. If you have interest in doing research with me, you are welcome to send me email detailing your background and your research interests. Note that admissions are determined by a committee. No Summer Internships: I do not have summer internship opportunities available. I regret that I will be unable to respond personally to such requests.
