Jean is interested in the application of geometric methods to problems in engineering. In particular, he is investigating methods for smooth surface reconstruction from 3D meshes. He is also interested in methods for statistical analysis in medical imaging, and focuses on diffusion tensor imaging. In his work to resolve the difficulties of the non-Euclidean domain of these images, Jean applies Riemannian geometry as a framework for problem solving.
