Most of my work so far has been in permutation enumeration and its connections to symmetric function theory and combinatorial Hopf algebras. In other words, I enjoy solving counting problems involving permutations and developing general frameworks for studying these kinds of problems, often drawing upon the rich interplay between combinatorics and abstract algebra. I am excited at the prospect of introducing the joy of mathematical discovery to undergraduate students at Davidson and collaborating with them on future projects. I am also interested in the role of social identity in the mathematics classroom, and as an educator, I aim to instill self-confidence in my students and to foster a sense of belonging. I enjoy using teaching methods that allow my students to be active participants in their own learning.
