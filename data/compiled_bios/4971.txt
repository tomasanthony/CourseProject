He is an authority on the subjects of collisionless shock structure, magnetic reconnection, and plasma waves and instabilities. Research Interests Theoretical space plasma physics and numerical methods, the development and use of large scale numerical simulation codes that assist in the study of the complex nonlinear behavior of space plasmas.
