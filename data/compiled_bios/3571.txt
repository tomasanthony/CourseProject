Research Centers CITRIS People and Robots (CPAR) Tsinghua-UC Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) . . Biography Kameshwar Poolla received his B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 1980; and his Ph.D. from the Center for Mathematical System Theory, University of Florida, Gainesville in 1984, both in Electrical Engineering. He served on the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana from 1984 through 1991. Since 1991, he has been at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is now Professor in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. He has also held visiting appointments at Honeywell, McGill University, and MIT and has worked as a Field Engineer with Schlumberger AFR, Paris. He was co-founder of OnWafer Technologies, a start-up that offered yield enhancement and metrology solutions for the semiconductor industry. OnWafer was acquired by KLA-Tencor in 2007. Dr. Poolla was awarded the 1984 Outstanding Dissertation Award by the University of Florida; the 1988 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award; the 1993 Hugo Schuck Best Paper Prize; the 1994 Donald P. Eckman Award; a 1997 JSPS Fellowship; the 1997 Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of California, Berkeley; and the 2004 and 2007 IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing Best Paper Prizes. He is the Cadence Design Systems Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering. Dr. Poolla has been awarded 5 patents. . . Selected Publications G. Cavraro, R. Arghandeh, K.
