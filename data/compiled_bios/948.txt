Jackson Mailing Address Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, 40 St.George Street, Rm.7224, Toronto, ON, M5S 2E4, Canada Office BA 4228 Email krj [at] cs [dot] utoronto [dot] ca Phone 416-978-7075 Fax 416-946-7132 Biography Ken Jackson was born in Montreal, but grew-up in Toronto. He received all his degrees from the University of Toronto: a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in 1973, an MSc in Computer Science in 1974, and a PhD in Computer Science in 1978. He then spent three years in the Computer Science Department at Yale University, first as a Gibbs Instructor and then as a visiting Assistant Professor, before returning to the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto in 1981 as an Assistant Professor and NSERC University Research Fellow. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1986 and to Full Professor in 1992. He was Associate Chair for Graduate Studies from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2005. Research Interests His primary research interest is numerical computation, with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and the associated problems in linear and nonlinear algebra. One focus of his work has been parallel methods for both initial-value problems (IVPs) and boundary-value problems for ODEs. Another focus has been validated (i.e., interval) methods for IVPs for ODEs. Recently, he has become interested in applying numerical methods to practical problems: computational finance, medical imaging and gene regulatory networks in particular. Past projects include numerical methods for weather forecasting, climate modeling and air quality modeling. More specifically, his research interests include: Numerical methods, analysis and computation Scientific computing and computational mathematics Mathematical software Parallel computation Numerical solution of initial and boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations and related methods for partial differential equations Numerical methods for linear and nonlinear equations that arise in the numerical solution of differential equations Validated solution of differential equations Solution of large sparse linear systems Computational finance Medical imaging Gene regulatory networks Numerical weather prediction and climate modeling Numerical air quality modeling Courses Fall 2018: CSC 336 : Numerical Methods MMF 2021 : Numerical Methods for Finance Winter 2019: CSC 446/2310 : Computational Methods for Partial Differential Equations Winter 2018: CSC 466/2305 : Numerical Methods for Optimization Problems Winter 2010: CSC 2307 : Numerical Software Selected Publications Theses of Students Supervised Other Points: I was president of the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society from June 2001 to June 2003.
