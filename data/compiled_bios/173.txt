 Fundamentals of Networking Laboratory Menu Home Publications Research Members Resources Overview Ongoing research at FUNLAB, The University of Washington is focused on fundamental issues underlying the design and analysis of next generation digital networking infrastructure. Current research embraces a wide variety of issues pertinent to both wireless and wired/fiber networks, that includes and integrates the design of physical, data-link layer and the transport layers. Next generation digital wireless networks must accommodate growing numbers of mobile users requiring high data rates (multimedia services) and greater mobility support in a physical environment that is both power/bandwidth limited. Such a formidable challenge requires innovations at all levels in the network, and research at FUNLAB addresses design problems that engage multiple layers, from the physical (transceiver design aspects) to the network transport (routing).
