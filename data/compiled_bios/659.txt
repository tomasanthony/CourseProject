(Please contact me at zmao AT umich.edu.) Postdoc position available in systems security: (Starting Jan 2018): I am looking for strong candidates in systems security (ideally with background in programming languages, software analysis) on projects in vehicular security, mobile security, and network security.(Please contact me at zmao AT umich.edu.) Teaching I am teaching EECS589: Advanced Computer Networks this semester. EECS388: Computer Security [W2015] EECS 591: Distributed Systems [F2013] EECS280: Programming and Data Structures [W08][W09] CS489: Computer Networks [W09],[W07],[F05],[F04] CS589: Advanced Computer Networks [F07],[F06],[W06],[W05],[F08],[F09],[F10]. CS598-4: Advanced Topics in Computer Networks [W04] Research My research interests encompass network systems, mobile and distributed systems, and network/systems security. My work involves both empirical data collection and analysis, as well as the design and implementation of new systems. Here are some of my ongoing projects: Mobile computing, networking issues in data cellular networks, applications on smartphones (3gtest, MobiPerf, PowerTutor [news coverage on IEEE Spectrum] ). Mobile cloud computing, data center networking. Network management for enterprise and ISP networks. Android security, side channels, malware characterization and deterrence. Here is my group Web page. Please visit the MobiLab project page for mobile computing research, including the MobiPerf and the Mobilyzer project. Please visit Side channels, TCP attack and Whisper for security projects. Please visit COMET for mobile systems research.
