Compatibility and Security Isolation In a multi-tenant environment, applications running inside containers or pico-processes, can be isolated by virtualization or library OSes. Graphene library OS Secure Operating Systems OSes are too complex to trust. A microkernel or a trusted hardware, such as SGX can reduce the risk of compromises, or protect applications from malicious hosts. OS Design Principles Decades of system research requires re-visiting the principles. Topics like compatibility need better methods for evaluation and reasoning.
