Sunil Prabhakar Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 1998 EducationPhD, University of California, Santa Barbara, Computer Science (1998) MS, University of California, Santa Barbara, Computer Science (1998) BTech, Indian Institute of Technology, Electrical Engineering (1990) Dr. Prabhakar's research lies in the area of data management. His current research focuses on developing novel database systems for managing probabilistic (uncertain) data, and ensuring authenticity and integrity of outsourced databases. In earlier work he has addressed performance issues in large-scale, modern database applications such as multimedia, moving-object, and sensor databases. The efficient execution of I/O is a critical problem for these applications. Dr. Prabhakar's interest also lies in the design and development of digital rights management for database using digital watermarking techniques for structured (e.g. relational databases) and semi-structured (e.g., XML) data. Prior to joining Purdue, Dr. Prabhakar held a position with Tata Unisys Ltd. from 1990 to 1994.
