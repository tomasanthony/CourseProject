Murray Thomas E. and Doris Everhart Professor of Control & Dynamical Systems and Bioengineering California Institute of Technology Papers Research Group Teaching Contact Quick Links: Group Schedule CMS 273 Feedback Systems Biomolecular Feedback Systems Prospective postdocs : I typically make decisions about postdocs in the April-May timeframe, when I know what my grants look like for fall. Please take a look at my current research interests to see what projects we are currently working on. Research My group's research is in the application of feedback and control to networked systems, with applications in biology and autonomy. Current projects include work on biomolecular feedback systems, novel architectures for control systems, and networked control systems (see my research overview for more details).
