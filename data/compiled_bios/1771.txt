He received a BS in computer science from Memphis State University in 1981 and a PhD in computer science from the University of Utah in 1987. Since 1997, he has been on the faculty in Computer Science at the University of Utah. He was a visiting professor at the University Joseph Fourier in 2011-201, a SimTech Fellow at the University of Stuttgart in 2012, and a visiting scientist at INRIA-Rhone in the GRAVIR group in 2004-2005. From 1989 to 1997, he was a Technical Staff Member in the Advanced Computing Laboratory (ACL) located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he formed and directed the visualization efforts in the ACL. He was a Bourse de Chateaubriand PostDoc Fellow at INRIA, Rocquencourt France, in 1987 and 1988. Chuck Hansen has published over 160 peer reviewed journal and conference papers and has been a co-author on three papers recognized with ``Best Paper Awards'' at the IEEE Visualization Conference (1998, 2001, 2002). He was co-author on the Best Paper at IEEE Pacific Visualization 2010. He was awarded the IEEE Technical Committee on Visualization an Graphics "Technical Achievement Award" in 2005 in recognition of seminal work on tools for understanding large-scale scientific data sets. In 2017, he was awarded the IEEE Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics "Career Award" In recognition for his contributions to large scale data visualization, including advances in parallel and volume rendering, novel interaction techniques, and techniques for exploiting hardware; for his leadership in the community as an educator, program chair, and editor; and for providing vision for the development and support of the field. Chuck Hansen served on the VGTC Board from 1995-2002. He was on the IEEE Visualization Conference Steering Committee from 2001-2004 and intitiated term limits during that time. He has co-Chaired IEEE Visualization 2000, was Program co-Chair for Visualization '99 and served as a papers co-Chair for IEEE SciVis (then called IEEE Visualization) in 2007-2008. He co-Chaired IEEE LDAV in 2014. He is currently an Associate Editor in Chief (AEIC) of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and was previously an AEIC for TVCG as well as on the editorial board of Elsevier Computers and Graphics Journals. His research has made contributions to the fields of scientific visualization, computer graphics, parallel computation and computer vision.
