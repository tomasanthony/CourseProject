I work to reduce the barrier to developing, deploying, and managing applications that are able to process massive amounts of data, while ensuring that the resulting systems are practical, low cost, and energy efficient. My research specifically focuses on: i) improving the networks that underpin data-intensive clusters and data centers so that they can support a new generation of applications, and ii) enabling developers and operators to build systems that support data sizes an order of magnitude greater than the existing state of the art.

Im the Co-Director of the Center for Networked Systems , and a Co-Founder of inFocus Networks . I have received a Google Focused Research Award , a NetApp Faculty Fellowship , and the NSF CAREER award. Previous to joining U.C. San Diego, I obtained my Ph.D. from the RAD Lab in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at U.C. Berkeley . Before that I was an undergraduate in the Department of Computer Sciences at U.T. Austin . Fun fact : My Erdos number is 3 (Me Scott Shenker Foong Frances Yao Paul Erds ) and my Bacon Number is 3 , making my Erdos-Bacon number 6 .
