 Professor E. Bagan PhD Autonomous University of Barcelona Visiting Professor Tel: (+852) 2859 2350 Fax: (+852) 2559 8447 Email: ebagan@cs.hku.hk My career as a physicist covers mainly two domains: particle physics and quantum information. During my PhD and my postdoctoral years I focused on phenomenology in high energy physics. Latter on, after becoming associate professor at the UAB, my research interests grew more theoretical and I worked in mathematical problems in gauge theories. About 18 years ago, I become aware of the new and exciting developments in quantum information technologies and I started to work in this field. Since 2006 this has been my main research area. I have written more than 70 publication in quantum information (QI), most of them in top-ranking journals. I have given more than 40 talks, most of them by invitation, on various QI topics. My list of collaborators in QI include R. Tarrach (which whom I also collaborated extensively during my particle physics years), A. Acn, R.D. Gill, V. Buzek, J. A. Bergou, C. M. Caves, F. Verstraete, G. Chiribella, M Hayashi and M. Hillery. Likewise, I have published more that 60 research articles in particle physics, also in top-ranking research journals, and have an extensive list of collaborators. I am A. V. Humboldt Fellow and I was a researcher at Brookhaven (BLN), New York, at the University of Cambridge, and at the University of Heidelberg. Recently, I have been a Visiting Professor at CQT Singapore and Hunter College of the City University of New York. Research topics: Quantum Information: Quantum Statistical Inference (state and process estimation and discrimination), Gaussian states, Quantum State discrimination, Quantum Metrology. Quantum Machine Learning. Quantum Cloning. Resource theory. Former research topics: High Energy Physics, Strong Interactions, QCD, Heavy Quarks, Gauge Theories.
