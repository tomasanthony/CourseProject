I work in Data Radio, Networking, Sensor Networks and Indefinite Systems; when a discrete, computable system must be built where critical parameters are either impossible or infeasible to know.Building off of my experiences as an Eagle Scout, I was granted a Congressional nomination to West Point in 1996 but turned it down in lieu of ROTC. Three months before contracting with the Army I was disqualified medically due to my eyesight. I went on to complete a B.S. at Rutgers Univerisity in 2002, majoring in Computer Science. I came back to Rutgers after exploring the private sector and received a PhD in Computer Science in 2015. I taught a range of courses part-time as a graduate student, and after graduating was hired on to Rutgers' teaching faculty.
