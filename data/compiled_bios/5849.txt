Petros A. Ioannou received the B.Sc. degree with First Class Honors from University College, London, England, in 1978 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois, in 1980 and 1982, respectively. During the period 1975-1978, he held a Commonwealth Scholarship from the Association of Commonwealth Universities, London, England. He was awarded several prizes, including the Goldsmid Prize and the A. P. Head Prize from University College, London. From 1979 to 1982 he was a research assistant at the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois. In 1982, Dr. Ioannou joined the Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. He is currently a Professor in the same Department and the Director of the Center of Advanced Transportation Technologies. His research interests are in the areas of control and applications, adaptive and nonlinear systems, vehicle dynamics and control, intelligent transportation systems, marine transportation, congestion control of computer networks and neural networks. He was visiting Professor at the University of Newcastle, Australia in the Fall of 1988, the Technical University of Crete in summer of 1992 and served as the Dean of the School of Pure and Applied Science at the University of Cyprus in 1995. In 1984 he was a recipient of the Outstanding Transactions Paper Award for his paper, An Asymptotic Error Analysis of Identifiers and Adaptive Observers in the Presence of Parasitics, which appeared in the IEEE Transactions on Automa! tic Control in August 1982. Dr. Ioannou is also the recipient of a 1985 Presidential Young Investigator Award for his research in Adaptive Control. He has been an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, the International Journal of Control and Automatica. He is currently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Associate Editor at Large of the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Member of the Control System society on IEEE ITS Council Committee and Vice-Chairman of the IFAC Technical Committee on Transportation Systems. Dr. Ioannou is a Fellow of IEEE and the author/co-author of 5 books and over 150 research papers in the area of controls, neural networks, nonlinear dynamical systems and intelligent transportation systems.Research Summary1.Control Systems and Applications   This research includes:  -Design and analysis of robust adaptive and nonlinear control systems for systems with unknown parameters and nonlinearities.  -Control of large flexible structures  -Control and modeling of large segmented telescopes  -Control of disk drives -Control of hypersonic aircraft  -Failure detection and accommodation and reconfigurable control designs   2.
