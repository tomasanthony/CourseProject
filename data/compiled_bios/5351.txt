About I'm an Associate Professor (Senior Lecturer) in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh , where I'm affliated with the Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA) . I'm also a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute (ATI) , UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence (AI). In the School of Informatics, I participate in two centers for Doctoral Training (CDT): Pervasive Parallelism and Data Science . Before moving to the UK, I was an independent research group leader in the (cfaed) Cluster of Excellence at TU Dresden , where I ledtheParallel and Distributed Systems group. I graduated witha PhD in Computer Science from the Systems group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) . During my PhD, Ive had fruitful internships/collaborations with Microsoft Research , IBM Research , Yahoo! Research and Bell Labs . Prior to joining MPI-SWS, I worked as a member of technical staff at Adobe Systems and in the HPC group at IBM ResearchIndia . Before that, I was a graduate student at IIT Kanpur . Research Im a systems researcher: I love to design and build systems! A common goal of my research is to build computer systems that are efficient, reliable, and secure. As an experimental computer systems researcher, I work at the intersection of operating systems, distributed systems, storage systems, system security, "Big Data" systems, and cloud computing. In the past, I've also worked on compilers for multicores, and high performance computing.
