I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Liverpool , associated with the Algorithm Group . Prior to joining UoL, I was a post-doctoral fellow in HKU. My research interests are on the design and analysis of algorithms for optimization problems. I focus on designing on-line and approximation algorithms in various application areas, including job scheduling, bin packing, multimedia streaming, load balancing and network routing. I have also worked on optimization problems in other areas including computational biology and wireless communication algorithms.
