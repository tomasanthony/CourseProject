 Main Research Teaching Professional Activities Contact Ruta Mehta Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign My main research interests lie in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mathematical economics, and in design of efficient algorithms. I am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and Nash, under various settings, and related total search problems from classes PPAD, PLS, and CLS. In addition, I am interested in understanding the impact of strategic behaviour in multi-agent systems, e.g., social networks, fair division of scarce resources, and markets for cloud computing, and avenues for their interdisciplinary applications. Prior to joining UIUC, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Simons Institute for Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley , and at College of Computing , Georgia Tech (host: Prof. Vijay V. Vazirani ). I received my Ph.D. in computer science from IIT-Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Milind Sohoni and Prof. Bharat Adsul. My Ph.D. thesis titled "Nash Equilibrium Computation in Various Games" won the ACM India Doctoral Dissertation Award, 2012 . Here is my CV (updated: 08/06/2017). Received NSF CAREER Award on Equilibrium Computation and Other Total Search Problems (2018-2023). Thank you NSF!
