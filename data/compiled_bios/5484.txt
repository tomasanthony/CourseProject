Hedrick Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 390 607/255-0429 Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 390 607/255-0429 crj2@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography C. Richard Johnson, Jr. was born in Macon, GA in 1950. He received a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, along with the first PhD minor in Art History granted by Stanford, in 1977. After 4 years on the faculty at Virginia Tech, he joined the Cornell University faculty in 1981, where he is the Geoffrey S. M. Hedrick Senior Professor of Engineering and a Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellow. At the start of 2007, following 30 years of research on adaptive feedback systems theory and blind equalization in communication receivers, Professor Johnson accepted a five-year appointment as an Adjunct Research Fellow of the Van Gogh Museum (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) to facilitate the interaction of art historians and conservation specialists with algorithm-building signal processors. In 2012, Professor Johnson was appointed a Scientific Researcher of the Rijksmuseum. Research Interests Digital Signal Processing (Primary Specialization: 1977-1991: Adaptive Feedback Systems Theory; 1991-2005: Blind Equalization in Digital Communication Receivers; 2005-present: Signal Processing Algorithms in Support of Painting Analysis) Signal and Image Processing Systems and Networking Research Group Members. Teaching Interests Applications of adaptive signal processing in communication and control systems Applications of image processing to analysis of old master paintings Digital feedback control design.
