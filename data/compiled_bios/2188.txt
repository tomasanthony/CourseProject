Syriani, Eugne	I am currently an assistant professor in Computer Science at the University of Montreal. I am a member of the GEODES Software Engineering Research Group. I teach bachelor, masters and doctoral level courses in software engineering. I serve on the program committee and organize several international conferences and workshops. I am also a reviewer for journals in modeling and simulation.I was formerly an assistant professor at the University of Alabama until 2014. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 and hold B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science since 2006, both at McGill University. Affiliated to McGill, I also pursued postdoctoral research on model transformation in the Canada-wide NECSIS project on model-driven engineering for automotive systems.I have also worked as a software engineer in software companies in Montreal for a decade.
