Tech, Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Research My research is motivated by practical problems in software and systems security , and emphasizes building real systems. It draws on principles and techniques from programming languages and compilers , operating systems , algorithms , networks , and artificial intelligence to address problems such as: Binary analysis and instrumentation Software vulnerability mitigation (buffer overflows, SQL injection, XSS, ...) Malware and untrusted code defense High-performance intrusion detection (network and host-based) Attack isolation and recovery Several of my current PhD students are graduating this year, so I am looking to replenish the pipeline. If you are a PhD (or a BS or MS) student looking for an advisor, please send me email. You can learn more about my research at Secure Systems Laboratory web pages. Check out our alumni pages to know where some of our past students are. Teaching I am teaching CSE 548 (graduate algorithms) in Spring 2016. Here is a link to the course web page, containing materials used when I taught this course in Fall 2014. Here is a list of courses that I have taught recently.
