Antony L. Hosking Adjunct Associate Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Spring 1995 EducationPhD, University of Massachusetts, Computer Science (1995) MSc, University of Waikato, Computer Science (1987) BSc, University of Adelaide, Mathematical Sciences (1985) Dr. Hosking works in the area of programming language design and implementation, with specific interests in implementation of managed languages (e.g., Java, C#), database and persistent programming languages, dynamic memory management ("garbage collection"), compiler optimizations, and architectural and operating system support for programming languages and applications. He is co-author of the landmark reference work on automatic memory management ??? 	The Garbage Collection Handbook: The art of automatic memory management 	. Dr. Hosking was named a Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2012, and is a Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
