Professor John W. Byers joined the BU Department of Computer Science in 1999. His research interests center on data-analytic and algorithmic challenges in two disciplines: the science of computer networking (e.g., transport protocols, network architecture) and the empirical study of Internet platforms (such as Airbnb, Groupon, and Yelp). His work strikes a balance between theoretical foundations and rigorous data-driven experimentation. John is Founding Chief Scientist and a member of the Board of Directors at Cogo Labs, a start-up based in Cambridge, MA, where he has had an executive role since the companys founding (as Adverplex, Inc.) in 2005. Cogo leverages a proprietary technology platform for online advertising, algorithmic marketing, and data science analytics to power their incubated portfolio companies from inception to profitability and beyond.
