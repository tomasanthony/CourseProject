Cheriton School of Computer Science	University of Waterloo	Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1	Office: DC 3526	Phone: 519-888-4567 x36163	Email:	firstname.lastname@uwaterloo.ca	Menu:	Home	Publications	Students	Teaching	Professional Activities	Software	My research interests are in information privacy and in computer and networks security with a focus on security and privacy challenges that arise in the context of smartphones and mobile applications. My students and I develop privacy-preserving technologies for location-based services and mobile applications to protect users from having to share their personal information with service and application providers. We also study implicit authentication for smartphones, where a smartphone continuously authenticates its owner based on the owner's behaviour without requiring deliberate actions by the owner. I have also worked on privacy-preserving location verification technologies, genomic privacy, and end-to-end voter-verifiable voting systems.	I am a member of the Cryptography, Security, and	Privacy (CrySP) research group, the	Centre	for Applied Cryptographic Research and the Systems and Networking Group.	I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon in August	2005. Prior to that, I received an M.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon and a	Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH from ETH	Zrich (Curriculum Vitae).	Original design by Andreas Viklund
