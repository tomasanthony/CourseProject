The focus of my research is designing innovative tools for swarm robotics . Programming large-scale robot swarms I am developing Buzz , an innovative programming language specifically designed for real-world robot swarms. Buzz was widely covered in the media, most notably by MIT Technology Review , Communications of the ACM , and RoboHub . Accurate, physics-based simulation of robot swarms During my Ph.D., I have designed ARGoS , which is currently the fastest general-purpose robot simulator in the literature. ARGoS is used by many laboratories across the world to perform accurate physics-based simulations of large-scale robots swarms. I am continuously improving ARGoS to suit the diverse needs of the swarm robotics research community. Swarm robotics for disaster response I am working on swarm robotics solutions for disaster response scenarios, such as search-and-rescue and firefighting.
