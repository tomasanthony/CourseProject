Short bio I am faculty at Florida International University (FIU) in the School of Computing and Information Sciences (SCIS), and the Director of the Affective Social Computing Laboratory . My long-term research goal is to create VIrtual Social AGEnts (VISAGEs) that can interact naturally with humans with verbal and non-verbal communication,in a variety of contexts involving socio-emotional content (e.g. health counseling, educational games). My research thereforelies at the intersection of human-computer interaction,affective computing ( I co-founded the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing ), artificial intelligence, emotion and personality theories, social communication, and of disciplines providing the socio-emotional content where VISAGEs can beparticularlyhelpful (e.g. healthcare, education). My research has been funded by federal agencies in the USA andin Europe, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the US National Institute of Health (NIH), the US Department of Education, NASA Ames, US Army STRICOM, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the European Union Commission,as well as by industry such as Intel, Microsoft, STMicroelectronics, Numedeon Inc., and the Institute for Disabilities Research and Training.
