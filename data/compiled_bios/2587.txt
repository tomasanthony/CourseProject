Home About me Teaching Research Publications Resources Curriculum Vitae Daniel Leeds Assistant Professor Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies (Rose Hill) Computer and Information Science Department Fordham University Contact 332 John Mulcahy Hall Phone: 718-817-5196 E-mail: Teaching I am teaching Systems Neuroscience (CISC 3250) and Machine Learning (CISC 5800). Research interests I direct the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory at Fordham, powered by talented undergraduates and Masters students in Computer Science and Integrative Neuroscience. My research studies the computational principles underlying perception and cognition. I pursue connections between the statistical patterns of the natural world of sights and the resulting representations in the minds of human and animal observers. I also have begun work modeling potential sources of cognitive decline. My work draws on theories in computer vision, machine learning, psychology, biology, and statistics, among other areas. I also dedicate significant attention to the development and application of data analysis techniques to gain better understandings of neural (and other biological) data.
