Home	My research aim is to uncover mechanisms that underlie the computational and organizational aspects of the brain. For example, what function does feedback play in our brains, and how do our expectations influence our perceptions? I study these questions by modelling neural networks.	In a previous life, I did research in image processing and medical imaging, and taught a 4th-year course on medical image processing.
