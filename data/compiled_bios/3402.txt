 Matteo Riondato Home Short Bio CV (Updated: Jan 16) Publications Teaching Service Software Misc Contact info E-mail: riondato@acm.org Office: Science Center C214 Twitter: @teorionda GitHub: rionda PGP: 54255501 I am an assistant professor of computer science at Amherst College . I also have an appointment as visiting faculty in Computer Science at Brown University . Previously, I spent some fantastic years as a research scientist in the Labs group at Two Sigma . My research focuses on algorithms for knowledge discovery , data mining , and machine learning . I develop theory and methods to extract the most information from large datasets, as fast as possible and in a statistically sound way. The problems I study include pattern extraction, graph mining, and time series analysis. My algorithms often use concepts from statistical learning theory and sampling. My Erds number is 3 ( Erds Suen Upfal Matteo), and I am a mathematical descendant of Eli Upfal , Eli Shamir (2 nd generation), Jacques Hadamard (5 th ), Simon Denis Poisson (9 th ), and Pierre-Simon Laplace (10 th ). News Teaching: in my first semester at Amherst College, I'm teaching Data Mining and Intro to CS 1 . Thrilled to be working closely with brilliant students again. KAIS: an extended version of ProSecCo: Progressive Sequence Mining with Convergence Guarantees was invited to the special issue of KAIS for the best papers of IEEE ICDM'18 . PCs and editorial board: glad to serve on the PC for ICML'19 , ACM KDD'19 , NetSci'19 , and IJCAI'19 , and on the guest editorial board of the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal for ECML PKDD'19 . ACM TKDD: an extended version of MiSoSouP was invited to the special issue of ACM TKDD for the best papers of KDD'18 . SDM'19: I'm serving as co-chair of the Doctoral Forum for SIAM SDM'19 . Very excited to help with the organization, as I won the best student poster award at this event in 2014.
