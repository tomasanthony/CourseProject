Memberships and Other Interesting Stuff: Member, Journal Review Board, Applied Intelligence, 1993 Present Member, Association for Computing Machinery, 1983 Present Member, Professional Bowlers Association, 2012-2013 Trivial Facts: My father spent 27 years in the military, so when I was a child, we moved every couple of years. I've lived in about a dozen different places. I was born in Oklahoma, but we moved when I was only a couple of months old. I don't remember anything about being there, so I deny it really happened. I went to high school in Hawaii, which has lots of water and crowded beaches. After that, my family moved to El Paso, which is all beach but no water. When I first started at UTEP, they didn't have a department of Computer Science, so they had faculty from other departments teaching the CS classes. They also didn't have graduate students to serve as graders and TAs, so they hired me as the first "Undergraduate Teaching Assistant" to help the professors. I got to teach my first college class as a sophomore. When I was a student at UT, I lived in Jester. There was a girl who lived in a room about ten yards away from me. When we met at dinner the first week we arrived in Austin, we did NOT make good first impressions on each other: she thought I was a typical computer science geek, and I thought she was a stuck-up California girl. We've now been married for 32 years. University of Texas Page Last Updated: 12/22/2018 13:07:57 HTML
