She received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 1986, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rice University in 1989 and 1993, respectively. She is a fellow of the ACM and IEEE. Her areas of research interest include parallel and distributed computing, computer architecture, and the interaction and interface between the compiler, runtime/operating system, and underlying architecture. Her research lies at the intersection of computer hardware and software with a particular focus on support for parallelism. She has made fundamental contributions to the design and implementation of shared memory both in hardware and software, and to hardware and software energy- and resource-aware configurability.
