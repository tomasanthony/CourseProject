Energy-efficient microchips designed by EEMS-group students. Aeriel view of UCSD campus. A temperature sensor that consumes only 113pW during active mode. Aeriel photograph of La Jolla Shores and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography @ UCSD. Energy harvesting and sensing system that demonstrated energy extraction from the inner-ear for the first time (project with MIT, Harvard, and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 EEMS Lab at the University of California, San Diego The Energy-Efficient Microsystems Lab @ UCSD, led by Prof. Patrick Mercier , endeavors to imagine, create, prototype, and test systems for applications that can only be realized through extreme miniaturization of electronic devices. Since batteries nearly always limit system size, miniaturization requires either innovation in energy efficiency, or in ways to increase the energy available to the system. Applications targeted include biomedical electronics and ubiquitous computing/sensing. Please see the Research page for more details. Four papers at ISSCC 2019!
