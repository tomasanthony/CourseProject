Home Publications Projects Students Sponsors University of Toronto Computer Engineering Research Group (EECG) Personal I am a Connaught Scholar and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering ( Computer Engineering and Electronics groups) and Computer Science at the University of Toronto . My research interests include the development of CAD tools for the debugging, verification, synthesis and test of smart contracts, digital VLSI circuits and digital systems. I also have interest in theoretical computer science, game theoretical crypto-economics and cryptographic ledger technology. I obtained a PhD degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , Department of Computer Science , an MSc from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles , Department of Computer Science and an undergraduate Diploma from the University of Patras , Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics . I was a visiting faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998-99. I joined UofT in August 1999. I also held positions at Athens University of Economics and Business and at the University of Tokyo . Prior, I worked extensively in the entertainment industry and I was a consultant to an Internet start-up multimedia company in 1994-96. This company wrote its own little piece of history when it performed the first webcast ever for the 37th Annual Grammy Awards (March 1, 1995) later noted in the American Congress. I received a best paper award for work I co-authored at ASP-DAC 2001 and I have been nominated for two more best paper awards. I hold three patents. In 2013 I was nominated for the Bower Award and Price in Science by Prof. Stephen Cook for my contributions in the area of verification. At ASP-DAC 2014 I received a "Ten Year Retrospective Most Influential Paper" award. I am member of AAAS, ACM, AMS, IEEE, Technical Chamber of Greece, TTTC, Professional Engineers of Ontario and the Planetary Society.
