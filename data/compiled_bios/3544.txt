Kam Y. Lau: Contact Information klau@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Communications & Networking (COMNET) Optoelectronic devices; Microwave and millimeter wave signal transport over optical fiber links . . . Biography Kam Y. Lau is Professor emeritus in the EECS department at U.C. Berkeley. He received his B.S., M.S.and Ph.D degrees in 1978, 1978 and 1981 respectively; all in Electrical Engineering from Caltech. Upon obtaining his doctorate, he joined Ortel Corporation as founding staff/chief scientist. His research in semiconductor laser dynamics established fundamental limits in speed and linearity of directly modulated laser diodes, central to linear fiber-optic transmission products for Hybrid-Fiber-Coax (HFC) infrastructure widely deployed today for CATV-distribution and cable-modem internet-access - the basis of Ortels successes - its IPO and subsequent acquisition by Lucent/Agere. He received the 1996 IEEE LEOS William Streifer Scientific Achievement Award, the 1996 IEEE LEOS Distinguished Lecturer Award, the 2008 OSA Nicholas Holonyak Award, the 2009 IEEE David Sarnoff Award, the 2009 IET J.J. Thomson Medal and the 2010 Benjamin Oliver Gold Medal for achievement in engineering from the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association. He was an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University from 1988-90, and a professor of EECS at U.C. Berkeley since 1990. In 1997, he co-found LGC Wireless, Inc. (L of LGC.) LGC Wireless delivers cost-effective in-building wireless coverage and capacity solutions around the world. LGC Wireless was acquired by ADC Telecom (NASDAQ:ADCT) in 2007.
