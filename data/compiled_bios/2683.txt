 Katie Atkinson Department of Computer Science Home Research Publications Teaching People Activities Contact About me I am Professor of Computer Science and the interim Dean of the School of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Liverpool , UK. The School is comprised of two departments, Electrical Engineering and Electronics, and Computer Science, with staff in each department conducting innovative research within these fields and teaching on our research-connected education programmes. The School plays a central role in the University's interdisciplinary research theme on the topic Digital and we work with a variety of industrial partners to apply our research and involve industry in our education programmes. My own research concerns computational models of argument, which is a topic within the general field of artificial intelligence. A particular focus of my research is AI and Law, specifically computational argumentation for modelling legal reasoning. I have published over one hundred and fifty articles on these, and closely related, subjects. I work on both fundamental aspects of these research topics and applications in collaboration with industry partners. Details of my past and current research can be found in my publications list .
