 My academic interests include privacy-preserving technologies, e-voting security, eavesdropping and wiretap systems, operating system security, network and protocol security, and network intrusion detection. Basically, I like breaking stuff and occasionally fixing things. I am the director of the Georgetown Institute for Information Assurance and co-direct the CS SecurityLab. A more formal biography is also available.
