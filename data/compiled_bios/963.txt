I am part of the Theory Group , and work on theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence. About My Research Specifically, I work on problems at the intersection of computer science and economics, such as deciding how to aggregate individual preferences to make collective decisions (social choice theory), learning how self-interested agents behave in a system (game theory), and designing systems that perform well in the presence of self-interested agents (mechanism design).
