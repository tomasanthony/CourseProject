About Me I am an assistant professor at the School of Computing and Information Sciences , Florida International University . Before joining FIU, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, in 2017, and my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China, in 2009 and 2012. My research interest focuses on large-scale distributed storage systems with erasure coding. Merging the gap between theory and practice, my research studies both theoretical and practical challenges of deploying erasure coding in a distributed storage system with high performance and low resource consumption. Research interests erasure coding, distributed storage system, distributed computing, machine learning Page generated 2019-02-10 21:42:04 EST, by jemdoc .
