 Vasanta Chaganti Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Swarthmore College 500 College Avenue Swarthmore, PA 19081 252-D Science Center chaganti [at] cs [dot] swarthmore [dot] edu I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Swarthmore College . I have most recently been a post-doctoral scholar at UMass, Amherst , where my advisors were Prof. Jim Kurose and Prof. Arun Venkataramani . My research interests are in design and evaluation of next-generation network architectures, enabling device and content mobility in the Internet, and performance modeling and data analysis of large-scale networks.
