Ryan Stutsman Ryan Stutsman Assistant Professor University of Utah stutsman@cs.utah.edu Teaching - Projects - Publications - Talks - Activities - Blog I am an Assistant Professor and head of the Scalable Software Systems Lab in the School of Computing at the University of Utah . My interests include Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Databases. Im passionate about designing and building systems that allow large-scale applications to access data more intensively than has been possible in the past. My dissertation work, Fast Crash Recovery in RAMCloud provides durability and availability in a large-scale distributed DRAM-based storage system with the same price and energy consumption as todays volatile caches. Overall, it enables the use of DRAM as fault-tolerant large-scale data center storage which is 50 to 5,000 times faster than other data center storage systems. Formerly, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the databases group at Microsoft Research . Before that, I earned my Ph.D. at Stanford University working as a part of the RAMCloud and the Secure Computer Systems labs.

CS6963 Fall 2015 - Distributed Systems Projects Current Sandstorm/Splinter - A multi-tenant in-memory key-value store that operates on microsecond time scales with millions of operation per second while letting mutually distrusting tenants push extensions to it at runtime to customize its operations and data model. LSM-SIM - A trace-driven web cache simulator designed to simulate common and advanced eviction and memory management policies for large-scale in-memory caches, like memcached. Past RAMCloud - A high-performance distributed key-value storage system designed with latency goals to enable the next generation of data center applications. Deuteronomy - A fully lock-free transactional database engine that is performance competitive with modern in-memory databases. Deuteronomy maintains clean architectural separation of storage, indexing, and transaction components for flexible deployment in embedded, cloud, or data center systems. Cinder - An operating system designed for cellular phones and mobile devices with fine-grained energy accounting, allocation, subdivision, and delegation. HiStar - An operating system designed around decentralized information flow control. ROSE - A source-to-source compiler infrastructure for transformation and analysis tools for large-scale applications. AutoTest - A release-driven Linux kernel regression testing framework. Lost in Translation - A steganographic system that hides information in natural language translations.
