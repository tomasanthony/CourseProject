Professor Lugannani's technical contributions include: studies of structural properties (limit theorems, sample function regularity, characterizations of independence) of linear processes; numerical techniques for evaluating distributions and densities of linear processes and quadratic forms in Gaussian variables. Research Interests System modeling and analysis; structural properties of random processes; characterization of random channels-the optical channel; numerical evaluation of probability distributions and densities.
