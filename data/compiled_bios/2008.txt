 Giulio Chiribella Professor Department of Computer Science The University of Hong Kong Pokfulam Road Hong Kong Tel ( 852)28572193 E-mail: firstname@cs.hku.hk ( no capital letters) Education: PhD in Physics, University of Pavia, Italy (2007). Laurea Degree in Physics, University of Pavia, Italy (2003). About: I joined the University of Hong Kong in August 2015. Before joining HKU, I have been Associate Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing (2012-2015), and Postdoctoral Fellow of Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, Canada (2009-2012). Interests: My research is in the field of Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Foundations. I am interested in how the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics can be turned into advantages for future information technologies, and, conversely, in what the power of quantum technologies reveals about fundamental physics. The interplay between applications and foundations has led me to study quantum networks , quantum clocks and gyroscopes, quantum copy machines, and quantum computations with an indefinite causal order. On the foundational side, I am interested in the role of information theory in quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and spacetime physics. The long term goal is to reduce some of the now- puzzling phenomena in these areas to a small set of information-theoretic principles.
