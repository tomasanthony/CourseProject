 Stuart Anderson Deputy Head: School of Informatics Member: Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science Research projects (recent and current): Smart Society Social-ist Learning Environment for Mammographic Imaging INDEED The Dependability Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration "Chameleon" Project Dependable Service-Centric Computing Sustainable Lifecycles in Information Ecosystems Curriculum vitae Publications (still fixing this up) Another book from the DIRC project: Emerging Technological Risk I'm professor of Dependable Systems at Edinburgh. I'm particularly interested in socio-technical systems, resilience of such systems and how Social Science and Informatics provide a unique perspective on the conception, design, deployment and operation of computer-based systems. The Social Informatics Cluster in Edinburgh works closely with members of ISSTI and with the Edinburgh e-Health Interdisciplinary group. Currently we are working on Information Infrastructures and their role in analysing long-lived, large-scale systems. I'm also interested in Social Computation and Collective Adaptive Systems and recently have been working jointly with NHS24 and other Scottish Agencies on the development of a Digital Health Institute designed to stimulate innovation and knowledge exchange.
