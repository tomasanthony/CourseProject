 Diane Horton Associate Professor, Teaching Stream Diane Horton is an Associate Professor, Teaching, in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. She earned a BSc (Honours) at the University of Western Ontario and an MSc at the University of Toronto. She joined the Department of Computer Science as a faculty member in 1993 and served as Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies from 2002 to 2007. She has been very active in curriculum renewal and in designing co-curricular initiatives for undergraduates that develop career skills and build community. Diane has received three Computer Science Student Union Awards and was the winner of the 2006 Joan E. Foley Quality of Student Experience Award . In 2015, she received the University of Toronto President's Teaching Award . Most recently, she won a 2015-2016 OCUFA Teaching Award from the The Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations. Diane's research is in the area of computer science education. She studies the effectiveness of pedagogical approaches and interventions, with a focus on courses in the first-year sequence, when students are adapting to university and learning what it takes to succeed in computer science. She has particular interest in reflective writing and in self-regulated learning.
