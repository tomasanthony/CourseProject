 Dimitris Papadopoulos Teaching Research Personal e-mail dipapado at cse dot ust dot hk contact address CSE Department HKUST Clearwater Bay Hong Kong resume Personal I am an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Insitute for Advanced Computer Science of the University of Maryland at College Park working with professors <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~cpap/" ,="" target="_blank">Papamanthou and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/" ,="" target="_blank">Katz and I received my PhD in Computer Science at Boston University working under the advice of <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~nikos/" ,="" target="_blank">Nikos Triandopoulos . Before joining Boston University. My research is focused on the development of cryptographic protocols for verifiable computation, zero-knowledge proofs, data and computation privacy in the cloud setting, and blockchain seurity. I am interested in designing schemes that are provably secure but also in bulding optimized systems that implement them. Other areas of interest include theoretical cryptography, applied network security, and economics of secure cloud computing.
