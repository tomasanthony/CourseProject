Jeremiah M. Blocki Assistant Prof in Computer ScienceJoined department: Fall 2016 EducationPhD, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science (2014) BS, Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science (2009) At a high level Professor Blocki describes himself as "a theoretical computer scientist who is interested in applying fundamental ideas from computer science to address practical problems in usable privacy and security." He is especially interested in developing usable authentication protocols for humans. Are there easy ways for humans to create and remember multiple strong passwords? Can we design secure cryptographic protocols that are so simple that can be run by a human?Jeremiah has also developed algorithms for conducting privacy preserving data analysis in several different application settings including social networks and password data. Prior to joining Purdue Jeremiah completed his PhD on Usable Human Authentication at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of his advisors Manuel Blum and Anupam Datta. He also spent a year at Microsoft Research New England as a postdoc. Selected PublicationsEfficiently Computing Data Independent Memory Hard Functions. With Joel Alwen. CRYPTO 2016.
