News [ 5 September 2017 ] [New] Our paper on consistent robust regression will appear at NIPS 2017. Our work develops the first polynomial time algorithm that can solve the age-old problem of linear regression in a statistically consistent manner even when a large number of training data samples are adversarially corrupted. [ 15 May 2017 ] [New] Our paper on context-dependent clustering of multi-armed bandits will appear at ICML 2017. Our work demonstrates how improved recommendation systems can be developed by combining explore-exploit-style bandit techniques with collaborative filtering techniques. [ 12 November 2016 ] Our paper on optimizing multivariate performance measures in multi-label learning settings with weak supervision will appear at AAAI 2017. A preprint is available here . [ 03 October 2016 ] Our paper on optimizing the macro-F measure in multi-class settings will appear at ICDM 2016. A preprint is available here . [ 15 May 2016 ] Our paper on stochastic optimization techniques for the quantification and class prevalence problem will appear at KDD 2016. A preprint is available here . [ 11 April 2016 ] We are organizing the 2nd Indian Workshop on Machine Learning (iWML 2016) from July 1-3 at IIT Kanpur. Call for papers and participation details are available here . [ 19 September 2015 ] Our papers on robust regression and extreme multi label classification will appear at NIPS 2015. Preprints available here . [ 14 September 2015 ] I have been given the Dr. Deep Singh and Daljeet Kaur Faculty Fellowship at IIT Kanpur. I thank the donor Mr. Taranbir Singh for instituting this fellowship for encouraging new faculty. [ 14 September 2015 ] I have joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur as a member of the faculty. I am looking for motivated collaborators (which includes students) to work on problems in large scale machine learning. [ 15 July 2015 ] Our work on scalable iterative hard thresholding methods for M-estimation problems (NIPS 2014) will be presented at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (ISMP 2015), July 12-17, 2015. [ 27 Jun 2015 ] I have been given a reviewer award by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) for my reviewing work for the 2015 edition of the conference. [ 26 Jun 2015 ] Delivered an introductory tutorial on statistical learning theory and concentration at the MSR Summer School on Machine Learning at IISc.
