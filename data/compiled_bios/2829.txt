Home page of George Labahn	George Labahn	Director	Symbolic Computation Group	Professor and Director of Graduate Studies	David R. Cheriton School	of Computer Science	Previously : Associate Dean, Graduate Studies and Research	Faculty of Math	University of Waterloo	Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1	Office: DC3629	Phone: 519-888-4567 x34667	Fax: 519-885-1208	Email: glabahn@uwaterloo.ca	I am interested in many areas of computational mathematics. My main area	of research lies in the field of Computer Algebra with a secondary area	being in the field of Computational Finance. In addition, I am the	principal researcher in the MathBrush project, which seeks to create software	for doing mathematics on pen-based devices.	My work on computer algebra centers on effective algorithms for both exact	and symbolic-numeric computation. My work includes algorithms for	Matrix Normal Forms (polynomial and Ore domains), Greatest Common Divisors of	numeric polynomials, Differential equations (particularly those with elliptic	functions as coefficients) and Rational Approximation and Interpolation. My	main co-author in this topic (and numerous other topics) is	Bernhard Beckermann	My work in computational finance centers on fast, stable methods for	solving financial option problems, particularly options whose underlying	asset follows a jump diffusion pricing model. My main co-author in this	topic is	Peter Forsyth	My work on pen-based mathematics centers on the development of the	MathBrush penmath system. This work includes recognition of handwritten	mathematics along with understanding how mathematics can be done using	only a pen and a computer algebra backend,.	I am an associate editor of	Journal of Symbolic Computation (JSC).	I am a former associate editor of	ACM Transactions of Mathematical Software (TOMS).
