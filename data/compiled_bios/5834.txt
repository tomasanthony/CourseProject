Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, 1978, USC, Los Angeles, CA.  Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), 1991.Research SummaryTopological methods in robust control: control of (biological) chaos, quantum control (decoherence control), control of noncommutative dynamics. Coarse geometry methods in networks: network curvature, Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, with  application to routing, congestion, geographical localization in sensor network, and autonomous agents. Back-Pressure and Heat-Diffusion protocol in wireless networks. Quantum networks: dynamically controlled routing in spin networks. Smart grid: network approach, voltage stability, and false data injection detection.Awards2006  Best Paper2005 Who's Who in Sciences2001 Marquis Whos Who in Science and Engineering2000 Whos Who in the WorldAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - SystemsMathematics OfficeEEB 306Hughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2563 Contact Information(213) 740-4457jonckhee@usc.eduWebsitesPersonal Website"]
