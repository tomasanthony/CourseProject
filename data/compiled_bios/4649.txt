Before the merger of ECE and CS, he was a professor in Computer Science since his graduation from Princeton in 1993. Professor Planks research interests are in fault-tolerant computing, specializing in storage systems, checkpointing systems, erasure coding and distributed computing. His current research mission is to declutter the landscape of erasure coding for distributed and wide-area storage applications. Professor Plank teaches all programming classes, from the initial fresman course up to graduate operating systems. He has won the departments teaching award seven times, the College of Arts and Sciences Senior Faculty teaching award and the Chancellors citation for excellence in teaching. Professor Plank is a member of the IEEE Computer Society, has served as an Associate Editor for IEEE TPDS, has chaired conferences in network storage and network applications, and has left a legacy of publicly available software that includes: Jgraph a graph-plotting package for PostScript Ickp a checkpointing utility for the Intel Paragon Libckpt a checkpointing utility for Unix IBP Network storage depots and their client code LoRS Tools for aggregation of network storage depots Galois.tar A library for fast Galois Field Arithmetic in C and C++ Rsclib Fast and flexible erasure coding for storage applications Min H.
