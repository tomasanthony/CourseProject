About me [ CV ] I am an Assistant Professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Department of Computer Science . I have recently moved from University of Connecticut in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering . My research is at the intersection of Cyber-Physical Systems, Formal Methods, Autonomy, Embedded and Real-Time Systems, and Control Theory. I am looking for bright and motivated graduate and undergraduate students. Send me an e-mail with your CV if you are interested. I am currently working on developing frameworks for integrating safe autonomy into Cyber-Physical Systems. In my lab, we build, maintain, and prove the safety of autonomous CPS. In the recent past, I have contributed to developing scalable techniques for safety verification of linear hybrid systems. This technique (available here ) requires a mere n+1 simulations for computing the reachable set of n dimensional linear system. We have also implemented new constraint propagation techniques and dynamic aggregation techniques for verification of linear hybrid systems (available here and here ). This work has won the Best Paper Award at ARCH Workshop, 2017. My PhD thesis was about "Dynamic Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems". I have developed C2E2 , a tool that combines the scalability of simulations with the correctness guarantees of formal verification and applied it to analyze ALAS , an alerting system for a parallel aircraft landing protocol developed by NASA ( details ) and powertrain control systems in automobiles ( details ). In the past, I have worked on Probabilistic Systems, Automatic Test Input Generation, and Decision Procedures. News: [[January 2019]] I have moved to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and joined the Computer Science Department .

Congratulations to Abol, Reynaldo, and Manish and especially to Nandan who traveled to Porto and did a great job! [[March 2018]] Work with my student Manish Goyal titled "On Generating a Variety of Unsafe Counterexamples for Linear Dynamical Systems" has been accepted to ADHS 2018. We managed to define new notations of deepest and longest counterexamples and developed techniques to extract them. [[April 2017]] Joint work with Stanley Bak titled "Simulation-Equivalent Reachability of Large Linear Hybrid Systems with Inputs" has been accepted to CAV 2017. We improved the scalability of verification by two orders of magnitude and verified a 10,000 dimensional system. For details, check out the paper here . [[April 2017]] Presented a paper titled "Rigorous Simulation-Based Analysis for Linear Hybrid Systems" at TACAS 2017. The techniques presented in the paper have been implemented in our tool called HyLAA .
