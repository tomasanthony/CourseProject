Violet Syrotiuk  Violet R. Syrotiuk earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo in Canada. She started her academic career in 1999 with the University of Texas at Dallas, and joined Arizona State University in 2002 where she is now an Associate Professor. Her research interests are diverse, though primarily in wireless networks. These include: Experimentation on GENI and FIRE testbeds; applications of designed experiments, statistical analysis, time-series analysis, anomaly detection, and monitoring to cross-layer protocol design and optimization, and protocols adaptive to dynamic network conditions; applications of combinatorics to networking; and contention- and scheduled medium access control protocols.
