 Ayan Chakrabarti Assistant Professor Lab Website Research Professor Chakrabarti's research interests are in the fields of computer vision, computational photography, and machine learning. He works on developing systems that can recover physical reconstructions and semantic descriptions of the world from visual measurements, for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles, consumer photography, graphics and virtual reality, and more. His research focuses on ways to learn and exploit the statistical structure of natural images and scenes, to design efficient and accurate inference algorithms, as well as new kinds of high-capability sensors and cameras. Biography In September 2017, Professor Chakrabarti joins Washington University in St. Louis. He was a research assistant professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, and a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University. His research has been supported by a grant from the NSF, gifts from Adobe Research, and a hardware donation from NVIDIA.: . . . 314-935-4125 ayan@wustl.edu JolleyHall, Room 205. .
