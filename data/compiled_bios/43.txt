 Toggle navigation Nan Jiang Publications CS 598 Hi, this is the home page of Nan Jiang (). I am a machine learning researcher. My core research area is reinforcement learning (RL). I care about the sample efficiency of RL, and use ideas from statistical learning theory to analyze and develop RL algorithms. I am also interested in related areas such as online learning and dynamical system modeling. Prospective students: please read this note .
