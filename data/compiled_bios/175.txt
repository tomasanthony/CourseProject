Sahr Professor Associate Chair for Education and Entrepreneurship Home People John D. Sahr Appointments Professor, Electrical Engineering Adjunct Professor, Earth and Space Sciences Adjunct Professor, Aeronautics and Astronautics Biography John Sahr is a professor of electrical engineering, adjunct in Earth and space sciences as well as aeronautics and astronautics. His research in radar remote sensing of ionospheric turbulence involves the design, construction and operation of innovative passive radar systems, in particular the Manastash Ridge Radar. Furthermore, Sahr and his students have developed novel Direct Sampling radar receivers which have almost no analog components, and employ high speed sampling and digital signal processing to achieve enormous linearity and dynamic range. Sahr and colleagues have recently filed provisional patents building upon the passive radar receivers in preparation for a startup that has won funding from both the UW CoMotion Innovation Fund and the Washington Research Foundation. Research Interests Ionospheric physics; electrojet turbulence; passive bistatic radar; radar remote sensing; radar waveform design; radar interferometry; and statistical signal processing.
