Please contact me if you are interested. News [Call for paper] IEEE iThings 2019 , July 14-17, 2019, Atlanta, GA [Call for paper] Elsevier Physical Communication (IF: 1.522), Special Issue on Big Data Driven Millimeter Wave Systems . Submission deadline: September 1, 2019. Moved to Clemson University Fall 2018 Bio I received my second PhD in Computer Science (with a focus on cyber security) from Virginia Tech USA in 2018, and the first PhD (with a focus on wireless networking) from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications China in 2012. During the period from 02/2012 to 08/2015, I worked as a Research Fellow at Singapore University of Technology and Design , and then a Research Scientist at A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research (IR) , Singapore. From 06/2009 to 10/2011, I was a research assistant at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and University of Texas at Arlington , respectively. I received the Best Paper Award from IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) in 2013, the Erasmus Mundus Scholar Award in 2014, and the Pratt Fellowship at Virginia Tech in 2017.
