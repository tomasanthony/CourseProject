 Amir Kamil Amir Kamil Beyster Building 2632 2260 Hayward Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2121 (734) 764-2138 akamil AT umich DOT edu [Curriculum Vitae] Teaching I am a Lecturer at the University of Michigan. This semester, I am teaching EECS 285: A Programming Language or Computer System and EECS 490: Programming Languages. In the past, I taught EECS 183: Elementary Programming Concepts and EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures. Next semester, I am scheduled to teach EECS 280. Research I am currently doing research with the Computer Languages and Systems Software group at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. My work involves programming models, program analysis, languages, and compilers for parallel computing.
