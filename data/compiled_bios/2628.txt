He was a Research Assistant Professor at the Institute of Network Coding, the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 2013 to 2017. He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. His research interest is to develop general information measures and flow models from network information theory that are applicable to practical problems. His research topics include the development of network link models using matroids, the derivation of theoretical limits and optimal strategies for the problems of multiterminal source coding, data exchange, and secret generation. His most significant work is the extension of Shannons mutual information to the multivariate case, and the discovery of its connections to various problems in information theory and machine learning.
