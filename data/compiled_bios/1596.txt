All my 82 co-authors . Paper citations by Microsoft Academic Search . Software With my students I have built three major systems: D AGWOOD , DSC, and FoxBox. I am a founding member and co-designer of the LinBox library. A PP F AC are our Maple and Matlab packages for approximate polynomial GCD and factorization, ZNIPR our Maple package for sparse rational function model recovery. A RTIN P ROVER is our semidefinite programming-based software for exactly certifying global optima of semialgebraic problems. Grants The National Science Foundation has been the major provider of funds for my research. Undergraduate courses My subjects are: complexity theory, computer algebra, programming languages, data structures, introductory computer science, linear algebra Graduate courses My subjects are: algorithm design, programming languages, formal methods, parallel algorithms, symbolic computation High school summer program Paper on pedagogy Instructional software A popular Maple package is my RSA encryption. My course homepages link to additional software. Individual students for whom I have been research advisor Public lectures My screen files for several of my talks and my recorded voice are linked from the online document.
