 MILOS NIKOLIC Lecturer in Database Systems School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh milos.nikolic@ed.ac.uk My research interest is in databases and large-scale data management systems. My recent work studies in-database learning, stream processing, incremental computation, and query compilation. I am a member of the Database Group and the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science . bio | Google Scholar PROJECTS Incremental Maintenance of Complex Data Analytics maintaining a wide range of analytics using novel factorisation techniques Deep Analytics over Data Streams deep integration of relational and digital signal processing (DSP) DBToaster compilation of database queries into high-performance streaming engines TEACHING Instructor Advanced Databases (Edinburgh, Spring 2019) Databases (Oxford, Michaelmas 2017, w/ Tim Furche ) Object Oriented Programming (Oxford, Michaelmas 2016, w/ Joe Pitt-Francis ) Teaching Assistant Database Systems Implementation (Oxford, Hilary 2018, 2017) Concurrent Programming (Oxford, Hilary 2018) Compilers (Oxford, Hilary 2017) PUBLICATIONS Counting Triangles under Updates in Worst-Case Optimal Time , Ahmet Kara, Hung Ngo, Milos Nikolic, Dan Olteanu, Haozhe Zhang.
