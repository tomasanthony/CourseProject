Our paper on GANs got the Honorable Mention for Best Poster Award at the Southern California ML Symposium 2017 . I am giving a tutorial at NIPS 2017 along with Anand Sarwate on differentially private machine learning. More News Research My research is on machine learning. I am interested in the foundations of trustworthy machine learning, which includes problems such as learning from sensitive data while preserving privacy, learning under sampling bias, and in the presence of an adversary. I am also broadly interested in a number of topics in learning theory, such as confidence-rated prediction, non-parametric methods, online learning, and active learning. Here is a survey I wrote on machine learning with privacy. Here is an overview I wrote in 2008 about learning mixture models. Here is a press article on Biomedical Computation Review that talks about some of my work on privacy-preserving machine learning. My research is supported by awards from the National Science Foundation , the Office of Naval Research , Bloomberg LLC and Google . In the past, my research has been supported by the National Institute of Health and the Hellman Foundation .
