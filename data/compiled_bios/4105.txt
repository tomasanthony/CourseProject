Matt Dwyer ProfessorComputer Science Bio PhD, University of Massachusetts at AmherstMS, University of Massachusetts at BostonBSEE, University of Rochester Matthew B. Dwyer is a John C. Knight Faculty Fellow and Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. His research interests focus on methods for reasoning about the behavior of software. His prior work has improved and applied a wide-range of formal reasoning frameworks, such as model checking, symbolic execution, and abstract interpretation, to programs. His current efforts are exploring methods to assure the dependability of autonomous systems built from diverse component sources (e.g., software built by humans, trained by machine-learning approaches, or synthesized from high-level models).
