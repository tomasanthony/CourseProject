 Franziska Roesner - University of Washington Franziska Roesner Assistant Professor Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington Paul G. Allen Center, Box 352350 Seattle, WA 98195-2350 franzi@cs.washington.edu Security and Privacy Research Lab About Students Teaching Research Personal I am an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering and an adjunct assistant professor in the Electrical Engineering Department and the Human Centered Design and Engineering Department at the University of Washington . I am also affiliated with the UW Tech Policy Lab . My research focuses on computer security and privacy . My interests are broad within that domain, but I am particularly excited about designing and building systems that address security and privacy challenges faced by end users of existing and emerging technologies. I am the program co-chair for USENIX Enigma 2019 (and previously Enigma 2018 ), the now fourth iteration of a new security conference that focuses on high-quality talks about big ideas. Please consider submitting! I recently received an NSF CAREER Award (2017), an Emerging Leader Alumni Award from the UT Austin College of Natural Sciences (2017), an MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 Award (2017), and a Google Security and Privacy Research Award (2017). Some directions I'm particularly interested in at the moment (but not an exhaustive list!) include: Security and privacy for emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) Understanding and designing for the security needs of end users, such as journalists Studying privacy and security in the wild, such as by measuring third-party web tracking Last updated February 2019.
