My students and I work on all sorts of practical, hands-on security and privacy. The topics that I have been the most active in are: Analysis of online ecosystems Understanding domain squatting Measurement and countermeasures against unwanted tracking Assessment of the security of remote servers using mostly passive techniques Client-side defense mechanisms against phishing and web application attacks I received my B.Sc. ('07) and M.Sc. ('09) in Computer Science from the University of Crete, and my Ph.D. ('13) in Computer Science from KU Leuven. Before joining Stony Brook, I worked, for a year, as a Postdoctoral Researcher in KU Leuven.
