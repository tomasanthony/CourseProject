A recent result shows how to extend the Curry-Howard correspondence to session types. With Simon Gay and Nobuko Yoshida , I am leading the EPSRC programme grant From Data Types to Session Types: A Basis for Concurrency and Distribution (ABCD) ( EPSRC ). Agda. With Wen Kokke I coauthored the textbook, Programming Language Foundations in Agda . A paper describing the book appeared in SBMF 2018, and won the prize for best paper. Blame. The blame calculus , developed with Robby Findler , Jeremy Siek , and Amal Ahmed , integrates different type systems via casts. Casts may mediate between dynamic and static types, or between simple and dependent types. The key result is that when a cast fails, blame must lie on the less precise side of the cast. Links. I led the team that developed Links a programming language for web application development. My collaborators include Ezra Cooper , Sam Lindley , and Jeremy Yallop . Our work on formlets has been included in Intellifactory Web Sharper , and in libraries for Common Lisp , F# , JavaScript , Haskell , Racket , and Scala . XML. I represented Avaya on the W3C XML Query working group, which designed XQuery a query language for XML . My work on XQuery was done in close collaboration with Jerome Simeon and Mary Fernandez , who have an implementation of XQuery called Galax . I ran a workshop on XML and Data Binding . I formerly served on the W3C XSL working group, and I wrote a simple formal model for pattern matching in XSLT. Java. With Gilad Bracha , Martin Odersky , and David Stoutamire , I designed GJ , an extension of Java that incorporates generic types. With Benjamin Pierce and Atsushi Igarashi , I designed Featherweight Java , a small formal model of Java, comparable in simplicity to lambda calculus. With Maurice Naftalin I wrote Java Generics and Collections , published by O'Rielly. Functional languages . I was a principal designer of Haskell . With Simon Marlow, I developed a type tool for Erlang . I am a founding member of IFIP WG 2.8 Functional Programming , and served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Functional Programming . Logic and programming . I occasionally write and speak on the history of logic and programming languages , most recently a paper on Propositions as Types , which appeared in CACM and was presented at Strange Loop ( video ). At The Stand in Edinburgh, I performed a routine on Computability ( video ). Awards SIGPLAN Distinguished Service Award , 2016. ACM Fellow , 2007. Fellow Royal Society of Edinburgh , 2005.

Please submit to the above! Unusual applications Here are some unusual application of my work. Please let me know of others! Computational linguistics. Linguistic side effects , by Ken Shan cites my work on monads. The scope of alternatives and A modular theory of pronouns and binding by Simon Charlow cite my work on monads. Quantum computation. A Lambda Calculus for Quantum Computation and Quantum Computation, Categorical Semantics and Linear Logic , by Andre van Tonder cites my work on linear logic. Structuring quantum effects: superoperators as arrows , by Juliana Vizzotto, Thorsten Altenkirch, and Amr Sabry, relates quantum computing to monads and arrows. A linear-non-linear model for a computational call-by-value lambda calculus , by Peter Selinger and Benoit Valiron, relates quantum computing to both linear logic and monads. The Arrow Calculus as a Quantum Programming Language , by Juliana Kaizer Vizzotto, Andre Rauber Du Bois, and Amr Sabry, is based on my work with Sam Lindley and Jeremy Yallop on The Arrow Calculus . eScience. On providing declarative design and programming constructs for scientific workflows based on process networks , by Bertram Ludascher and Ilkay Altinas, models workflow on a grid for eScience applications with Haskell. Nanotechnology The Semantics of Jitter in Anticipating Time Itself within Nano-Technology , by Michael Heather, Nick Rossiter, and Dimitris Sisiaridis, cites my work on monads. Proof Assistants The proof monad , by Florent Kirchner and Cesar Munoz, applies monads to support computational features of proof languages, such as side effects, exception handling, and backtracking. Phenomenology Pragmatic phenomenological types , by Ted Goranson, Beth Cardier, and Keith Devlin, cites my work with Sam Lindley and Jeremy Yallop on The Arrow Calculus .

The TIOBE Programming Community Index tracks popularity of programming languages. "The ratings are based on the world-wide availability of skilled engineers, courses and third party vendors. The popular search engines Google, MSN, and Yahoo! are used to calculate the ratings." Lisp, Scheme, and ML rate mentions. Erlang and Haskell are tracked, but no ratings are reported since they are not in the top 50. Comments on the American election and www.sorryeverbody.com .

Leonardo da Vinci In most universities nowadaysand this seems to be true almost everywhereacademic staff find themselves spending less and less time studying, teaching, and writing about things, and more and more time measuring, assessing, discussing, and quantifying the way in which they study, teach, and write about things ... . It's gotten to the point where "admin" now takes up so much of most professors' time that complaining about it is the default mode of socializing among academic colleagues; indeed, insisting on talking instead about one's latest research project or course idea is considered somewhat rude.
