 Abhishek Chandra Home Research Publications Teaching Service I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities . My research interests are in the areas of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. I co-lead the Distributed Computing Systems Group in the department. My research has focused on resource management and performance in distributed systems, such as Clouds, Data centers, Grids, and Mobile platforms, with the goal of achieving higher reliability, scalability, and manageability. Much of my focus in recent years has been on designing and optimizing systems for data-driven computing: geo-distributed data analytics, social analytics, interactions of mobile computing (and now IoT) with the cloud, and data analytics in the cloud. Currently, I am working on a number of projects related to these systems, involving issues in data-intensive computing, mobile-cloud interactions, and social computing. I recently served as the Program Co-chair for IEEE IC2E 2018 and ACM HPDC 2018 conferences. I was also the TPC Vice Co-chair for the Edge Computing Track for IEEE ICDCS 2018 .
