I have worked on various problems related to type systems for programming languages, in particular, analyzing the computational resources needed for different kinds of optimizations (type inference, optimal reduction, intersection types and flow analysis, static analysis). This work has been motivated by many ideas from linear logic. More recently I am interested in developing a domain-specific programming language for string instrument design, where the language uses the same constructional vernacular found in the seventeenth-century methods, only with a more refined and specific computational interpretation.
