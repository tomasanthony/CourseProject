My research is in systems requirements engineering and software architecture. I study techniques and tools for modelling stakeholders goals, reason about these goals, and relate them to precise specification of software functional requirements, quality requirements and to the design of a software architecture that meet these requirements. I have a particular interest for the application of formal logics and Bayesian decision analysis for analysing complex software engineering problems. I chair the BCS Requirements Engineering Specialist Group . I have a PhD in Software Engineering from the University of Louvain in Belgium, an engineering degree in Applied Mathematics and a one-year conversion degree in Philosophy from the same university.
