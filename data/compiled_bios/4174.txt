Zach's research focuses on facilitating information sharing in today's Web and wireless worlds. He and his group are developing techniques for connecting different databases and applications together to them, regardless of possible variations and inconsistencies in terminologies or formats. They are also working on higher-level ways of programming large suites of heterogeneous sensor devices, and methods for automatically adapting these programs to target networks and devices. Zach's ultimate goal is to connect users or their applications with the data and in the format they need.
