 Richard T. Vaughan Professor School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University 8888 University Drive Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6 Canada vaughan@sfu.ca Office: TASC1 8009 and Senior Engineering Manager, Apple Inc. Cupertino, California On leave from SFU through 2019. I am not taking new graduate students. Research A video of a November 2018 research talk for a general audience (YouTube) autonomous mobile robots; multi-robot systems; human-robot interaction, robot software engineering I direct the Autonomy Lab . Our research goal is to increase the capabilities, robustness and overall autonomy of mobile robot systems. My research has these main themes: applying the latest AI-based sensing techniques to robot navigation and human-robot interaction creating tools and techniques for programming, simulating and evaluating populations of robots applying models of animal behavior to extend or improve robots, particularly multi-robot systems My lab is part of the NSERC Field Robotics Network . I am an Associate Member of the Behavioural Ecology Research Group at SFU.
