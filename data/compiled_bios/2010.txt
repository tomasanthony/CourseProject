 K.P. Chow M.A., Ph.D .( UC Santa Barbara) ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR INFORMATION SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRPHY Dr. Chow began his academic career in this department upon completion of his doctoral degree in the United States. His first contribution was on establishing HARNET , the first academic and research network for tertiary institutions in Hong Kong (with Raymond Lo and Dr. Ng). His earlier research works were in expert systems development and Chinese computing. In those years, Dr. Chow has used expert systems techniques successfully in implementing a staff roster rostering system for a local airline (with Dr. Lucas Hui ), a refuse collection vehicle scheduling system for Regional Services Department (with D. Hung and C.T. Hung), and an air conditioning plant diagnostic system. In the years 1994-1997, Dr. Chow, together with Dr. D. Cheung, Prof. Chin, Dr. T.W. Lam, Dr. W.W. Tsang and a team of software engineers developed the search engine for Hong Kong Telecom's 108 Telephone Directory Enquiry System using state of the art technology in main memory database and distributed computing. Since 1997, Dr. Chow is the Associate Director of Center for Information Security and Cryptography , Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, the University of Hong Kong, and is the Project Manager of the Strong Cryptographic Infrastructure for Electronic Commerce project. In the recent years, Dr. Chow' research interests have migrated to digital forensics and computer security, and is the leader of the Computer Forensics Research Group (CFRG) . Dr. Chow was the chief designer of the bilingual computer forensic tool Digital Evidence Search Kit (DESK). Starting from 2005, Dr. Chow has been working on the Internet piracy monitoring system Lineament I, and Internet auction site monitoring system Lineament II. Both Lineament I and Lineament II were adopted by HKSAR Customs and Excise Department in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Two of his research teams papers got the best paper awards in one of the reputable digital forensics research conference in USA in years 2008 and 2011. One of his teams research papers The Rules of Time on NTFS File System had been submitted to Courts of Hong Kong several times as a supporting document for the expert reports. Dr. Chow has been a member of the Program Committee of the international computer forensic workshop SADFE. He was the conference chairman of the Sixth IFIP WG 11.9 International Conference on Digital Forensics held in January in Hong Kong. From 2010, Dr. Chow is the Chairman of the Information Security and Forensics Society (ISFS), and a committee member of the IT Division, Hong Kong Institution of Engineers. Dr. Chow is the Programme Director for the MSc in Computer Science and the Associate Programme Director for the MSc in E-Commerce and Internet Computing Programme . He is the instructor for the course s e-Crime and e-Discovery and Digital Forensics . In both courses, he is responsible for the technical issues of digital investigation and computer forensics. Dr. Chow has provided consultancy and training to local organizations including Hong Kong Telecom, Hong Kong Airport Services Limited, Hewlett Packard and MPFA in the areas distributed computing, Internet technology and software quality assurance. In the past few years, Dr. Chow been invited to be a computer forensic expert to assist the Court and the HK law enforcement agencies, and to give advice to counsels on understanding and interpreting digital evidence for both criminal and civil proceedings in Hong Kong. In criminal proceedings, Dr. Chow had analyzed cases that include child pornography, software copyright, email analysis and Internet fraud. For civil litigations, Dr. Chow had analyzed cases that include activities log temporal analysis and internal investigation involving insider theft.
