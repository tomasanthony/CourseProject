John M.M. Anderson L K Downing Hall, Room 3006 (202) 806-4490 j_m_anderson@howard.edu Professor Brown University, 1985, Sc.B, Electrical Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, 1987, MSEE, Electrical Engineering University of Virginia, 1992, Ph.D., Electrical Engineering Image Processing, Signal Processing, Medical Imaging Dr. Anderson's general research interests lie in the areas of signal and image processing. Currently, the problem of reconstructing images for impulse and step frequency ground penetrating radar systems is receiving his greatest attention. In the past, he as developed image reconstruction algorithms for medical imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography. 1.
