 MO LI GROUP Laboratory of Photonic Devices home research publications news members gallery Home Research Publications News Members Gallery < > ] Research Synopsis: Our research focuses on integrated photonic devices, optoelectronic materials, and quantum phenomena. Our interests span from fundamental physics to engineering applications. We conduct experimental study on the fundamental coupling and interaction between photons, electrons, spins and phonons in a hybrid of nanoscale devices and materials. We employ state-of-the-art top-down approaches to fabricate devices and structures with a variety of materials. We utilize integrated photonic circuits as optical breadboards to investigate and exploit the optoelectronic properties of novel materials including 2D, magnetic and quantum materials. We perform measurement over an ultrawide spectral/frequency range from radio frequency and microwave to the infrared and the visible. We measure fundamental physics parameters with the highest possible precision, develop novel devices for microwave, optical and quantum communication and computation, and build tools for chemical and biomedical sensing, medical diagnostics and neuroscience. positions Available Join us on an amazing journey of light. Postdoc: We have an immediate opening for a postdoctoral associate to work in the areas of optomechanics and integrated photonics. To inquire, please send an email including a CV to Professor Mo Li (moli96 at uw.edu). Graduate Student: We recruit new graduate students every year. Prospective graduate students interested in joining our group should apply to the PhD program in either the Department of ECE or Physics. An undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, physics, applied physics or related fields is required. We acknowledge funding support provided by:
