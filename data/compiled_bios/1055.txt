In his dissertation, he designed robust and scalable geographic routing algorithms and protocols for wireless networks with large numbers of nodes and highly dynamic topologies. He was a staff scientist at ICIR , the ICSI Center for Internet Research (previously named ACIRI) at the International Computer Science Institute ( ICSI ) at Berkeley between the fall of 2000 and fall of 2002. While at ICIR, he worked on topics including scalable distributed storage for sensor networks, reordering-robust window-based congestion control, and traffic engineering for multi-hop wireless networks. He then spent three years as a Senior Staff Researcher at Intel Research Pittsburgh, and as an Adjunct Assistant Professor in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department. At Intel Research/CMU, he continued his long-standing research thrust on geographic routing (CLDP), and started new projects in distributed system architecture (Open DHT) and Internet worm defense (Autograph and Polygraph). Brad joined UCL in October 2005 as a recipient of a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award, where he is now a Professor of Computer Systems and Networks.
