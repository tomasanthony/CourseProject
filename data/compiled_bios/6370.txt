My research aims to build flexible computer networks and systems that meet the needs of the developers, operators, and users of emerging applications and networks. I take a full-stack approach, developing novellanguages, compilers,algorithms,operating system designs,andhardware designs.Upcoming research topics of interest include programmable network offloads and verifiable network stack programming. I also have ongoing research on network monitoring and congestion control.
