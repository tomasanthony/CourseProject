Richard Shi Chip Gallery Programmable deep learning accelerator iFPNA in 28nm CMOS supporting any CNN/LSTM/GRU [2017] TI SAR ADC & low threshold low power comparator, 65nm [2016] Deep learning processor OCEAN with 8 LSTM/GRU accelerators in 65nm CMOS [2016] About Us News The UW Silicon Systems Research Lab is currently focusing on energy-efficient nanometer integrated circuit and system design for sensing, learning, communication, and computing. In collaboration with Professor Michael Taylor, we are building in the industry start-of-art 14nm FinFET process RISC-V processor controlled deep learning accelerators Gbps high-speed interfaces Efficient mixed-signal Internet-of Thing sensing circuits for enabling AI-infused edges and clouds. We are particularly embracing the open-source hardware and software initiative for system innovation. Our lab has previously worked intensively on methodologies and tools to automate the design and verification of mixed-signal integrated circuits, resulting in commercial EDA tools and standards that have been used in production by the semiconductor industry.
