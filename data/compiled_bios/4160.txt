Sebastian's research focuses on the design and implementation of systems and network protocols that mathematically guarantee privacy and integrity properties under adversarial settings. He is particularly interested in developing the next generation of anonymous and censorship-resistant communication services, and in designing tools to help programmers build practical applications that incorporate security and privacy features as first class citizens. His recent projects make powerful cryptographic primitives (private information retrieval, zk-SNARKs) more accessible to system designers by increasing these primitives expressiveness and reducing their costs.
