Edwin Chihchuan Kan Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 325 607/255-3998 eck5@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Professor Edwin Kan received his B.S. in 1984 from the National Taiwan University. He received his Ph.D. from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992. He was a Senior CAD Engineer at Dawn Technology from 1992-1994. From 1994-1997 he was a Research Associate at Stanford University. He joined the faculty of Electrical Engineering at Cornell in 1997 as an assistant professor. Professor Kan is now a full professor.. Research Interests Passive RF tags for locating and sensing: mixed-signal waveform shaping by nonlinear transmission lines and active devices, ultra-low power oscillator-free millimeter-sized radio link, and harmonic backscattering for indoor locating. Nanoscale CMOS systems: Device and interconnect scaling to the 10nm technology. New structures and materials for logic and memory devices. New low-voltage and low-power circuits to support further technology scaling and new system functions. CMOS molecular interface biosensors: Integrated chemical, molecular and biological sensors and actuators based on charge-controlled surface electrochemistry. Functional specificity towards ion, molecules (DNA, mRNA, proteins and vesicles), action potential, pressure, impedance and morphology such as cell metastasis, and molecular folding. Technology CAD for VLSI design: Device and process simulation, SPICE compact models, numerical methods and software engineering. Construction of model hierarchy for better analysis and synthesis of the complex design. Sensors and Actuators Nanobio Applications Nanotechnology Semiconductor Physics and Devices Bioengineering Biomedical Engineering Solid State, Electronics, Optoelectronics and MEMs Research Group Members. Teaching Interests Professor Kan teaches graduate courses on Semiconductor Memories and RFID, and undergraduate courses on Introduction to Microelectronics, Quantum Mechanics, Silicon Devices, Digital Circuit Design, RF Systems, Robust Programming, and Nanofabrication.
