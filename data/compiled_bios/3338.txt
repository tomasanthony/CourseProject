Congratulations, Sid! Positions available: Postdocs in Cybersecurity + PhD students for Fall 2019 Yan Solihin is elevated to IEEE Fellow Publications UCF CyberSecurity & Privacy Software Home ARPERS ( A rchitecture R esearch for PE rformance, R eliability, and S ecurity) research group was formed in 2002 at NCSU by Prof. Yan Solihin and is now primarily homed at UCF. ARPERS focuses on computer architecture exploration and modeling to support cross-cutting design issues such as performance, reliability, and security. Yan Solihin is Charles N. Millican Chair Professor of Computer Science at University of Central Florida , Director for Cybersecurity and Privacy Cluster , and an IEEE Fellow. (Charles N. Millican was the founding president of UCF). He obtained B.S. in computer science from Institut Teknologi Bandung in 1995, B.S. in Mathematics from Universitas Terbuka in 1995, M.A.Sc in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University in 1997, and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2002. He is a recipient of 2010 and 2005 IBM Faculty Partnership Award, 2004 NSF Faculty Early Career Award, and 1997 AT&T Leadership Award. He is well known for pioneering cache sharing fairness and Quality of Service (QoS), efficient counter mode memory encryption, and Bonsai Merkle Tree, which have significantly influenced Intel Cache Allocation Technology and Secure Guard eXtension (SGX)'s Memory Encryption Engine (MEE). In recognition, he received IEEE Fellow for contributions to shared cache hierarchies and secure processors in 2017. He is listed in the HPCA Hall of Fame and ISCA Hall of Fame. Prior to joining UCF, from 2002-2018, he was a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NCSU. He joined as an Assistant Professor in 2002, was promoted early to tenured Associate Professorship in 2007, and was promoted early to Professorship in 2012. From 2015-2018, he was a Program Director at the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) at the National Science Foundation. His responsibilities include managing the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC), Computer Systems Research (CSR), and Scalability and Parallelism in the eXtreme (SPX). He co-founded the NSF/Intel Partnership on Foundational Microarchitecture Research (FoMR) program. He has published 90+ papers, authored 40+ patents, delivered 70+ invited talks/seminars, including several keynotes and multi-day tutorials. His research received MICRO Best Paper Runner-up Award (2017), IEEE Micro Top Picks (2011), and several Best Paper nominations/finalists (ISPASS 2013, IPDPS 2012, and HPCA 2005). He released several software packages to the public: ACAPP - a cache performance model toolset, HeapServer - a secure heap management library, Scaltool - parallel program scalability pinpointer, and Fodex - a forensic document examination toolset. His research has been covered by the IEEE Spectrum, US News, PC World, HPCWire, Slashdot, and others. He has written two graduate textbooks: Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture CRC Press, 2015 Fundamentals of Parallel Computer Architecture Solihin Publishing & Consulting, 2009 Additional Links: Yan Solihin's CV ( last updated October 2017 ) LinkedIn profile ResearchGate profile Google Scholar profile Funding.
