 Yu Feng Research Computer Science Department 2317 Speedway, M/S D9500 The University of Texas Austin TX 78712-0233 yufeng@cs.ucsb.edu I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UT Austin and my advisor is Prof. Isil Dillig . In Fall 2013 I studied as a visiting student at Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Saswat Anand and Prof. Alex Aiken . What's New I moved ! I will be joining the CS department at UCSB in Fall 2019. I'm looking for motivated students! Neo got the Distinguished Paper Award at PLDI18 ! Singularity got accepted at FSE18 ! Our research on Android malware detection is acknowledged by Google and receives the 2018 Google Research Award (PI: Dr. Isil Dillig)! Penta-kill! Neo got accepted at PLDI18 ! Quadra-kill! Themis got accepted at CCS17 ! Morpheus got accepted at PLDI17 ! Astroid got accepted at NDSS17 ! SyPet got accepted at POPL17 ! Research Interests My interests include programming languages, static program analysis/verification, program synthesis, and security. More specifically, I want to build automated tools to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a sound, precise and scalable way. I am also interested in applying static analysis to build and break systems, tackle security problems in smartphone.
