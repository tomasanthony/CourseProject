From 2012 to 2015 he was a Postdoctoral Fellow and Lecturer at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 2011 he completed a research internship at the Computational Genomics Lab at the Harvard Medical School. http://alexander-lex.net Current Responsibilities Dr. Lex develops interactive data analysis methods for experts and scientists. His primary research interest is interactive data visualization especially applied to molecular biology and pharmacology. His research is driven by the observation that there are many data analysis challenges that require human reasoning and cannot be solved automatically. He is also interested in Human Computer Interaction and Bioinformatics. He is a co-founder and leader of Caleydo, which is both open source software that can be used by life science experts to visualize biomolecular data and pathways, but also a platform for implementing prototypes of radical visualization ideas.
