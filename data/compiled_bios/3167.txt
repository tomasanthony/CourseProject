November 16, 2009: Due to popular demand, we are making the MATLAB code for our earlier paper on robust spectral shape correspondence available. Please download this ZIP file . The code can be easily adapted to compute the eigenvalue shape descriptors (EVD) from this paper . Instructions are contained in the README file. Note that this code does not contain a Nystrom approximation component, hence only somewhat small meshes (up to 5K vertices) should be tried on. The code was written by Varun Jain and last updated by Oliver van Kaick. If you have any questions, please ask Oliver or myself. There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; There is a rapture on the lonely shore; There is society, where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not man the less, but Nature more. - Lord Byron
