I think creating computer systems and software is great fun and I'm excited to be able to pass this on to another generation. My research and technical interests cover real-time and embedded systems and software, programming languages, operating systems, database performance, execution scheduling, and related topics in Computer Science. Research I have been involved in real-time systems and software research since 1982 in conjunction with a number of university programs and consortia. I have served as a leader for a number of international research and standards organizations such as the IEEE's Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems, IEEE's Standards organization that created the Unix standard (ISO/IEC 9945), Oracle's Java Community Process, and the Object Management Group's Architecture Board. Currently I am leading the development of a new standard for developing safety-critical applications using the Java language.
