 School of Computing University of Utah H. James de St. Germain Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor School of Computing University of Utah Greetings and Salutations My name is H. James de St. Germain, but feel free to call me Jim. I am an Associate Professor (Lecturer) for the School of Computing and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. My research interests include Reverse Engineering and Constraint Optimization. I am always interested in that nebulous area of Artificial Intelligence. I am currently pursuing technological aids for education. My Ph.D. work was done under William Thompson in the field of Legacy Systems Engineering, using constraint optimization. My dissertation: Reverse Engineering Utilizing Domain Specific Knowledge (C 2002) Current Quote of Interest The great mathematician G. H. Hardy said he didn't like math in high school either. He only took it up because he was better at it than the other students. Only later did he realize math was interesting -- only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly. To contact me: Dr. H.
