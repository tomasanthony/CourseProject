The Research Area Our research interests include the application of the mathematical theory of wave propagation to high performance analog circuit design with a special interest in: Novel integrated circuits for mm-wave and terahertz signal generation and processing Finding the fundamental limits of analog circuits and systems Extremely low noise circuits and systems using noise squeezing Low phase noise, wide tuning range voltage controlled oscillators High speed, low power ADC design Scattering theory for electrical media: Optotronics Ultra fast computation using 2-dimensional integrated structures As part of this effort, we have been able to blend multiple disciplines within the fields of electrical engineering, applied physics and mathematics into a coherent research theme resulting in multiple novel circuits for various applications. We design and implement circuits and systems in standard silicon CMOS and BiCMOS technologies as well as GaN substrate; however, the techniques and concepts could be implemented in other technologies or even in other engineering fields (e.g. optics and applied mathematics).
