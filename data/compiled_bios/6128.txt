Jim Fawcett Teaching Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-187 CST 315.443.3948 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D. from Syracuse, 1981 Research Interests: Complex software systems Code restructuring Software visualization Current Research: The main focus of my research groups work is on improving ways of understanding, assessing risk, and modifying software for very large systems in ways consistent with its required semantics. These systems often exceed several million lines of code embedded in thousands of packages. Our code restructuring research seeks ways of making semantics preserving transformations that improve the ability of developers to understand, maintain, and extend such large systems. One member of our group is working on high performance computing using GPUs to augment conventional processing. Teaching Interests: Software design: CSE687  Object oriented design, CSE776  Design patterns Software architecture: CSE681  Software modeling and analysis Cross platform development: CSE775  Distributed objects Web applications: CSE686  Internet programming Recent Publications: A New Cohesion Metric and Restructuring Technique for Object Oriented Design Paradigm, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Technical Reports, 2012 Measuring Specification Concordance with Semantic Mutation Testing, CATA 2011 RootBeer: Seamlessly Using GPUs from Java, HPCC 2012
