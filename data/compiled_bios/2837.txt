Jimmy Lin  Homepage	Jimmy Lin	University of Waterloo	Home	Publications	Projects	Students	Teaching	Resources	About Me	I'm a Professor and the David R. Cheriton Chair in	the David R. Cheriton School of	Computer Science at	the University of	Waterloo. Previously, I was at	the University of Maryland. I	completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science	at MIT in 2004.	My research aims to build tools that help users make sense of large	amounts of data. I work at the intersection of information retrieval,	natural language processing, and databases, with a focus on large-scale	distributed algorithms and infrastructure for data analytics.	From 2010-2012, I spent an extended sabbatical at Twitter working	on services designed to identify relevant content to users (search,	recommendation, etc.) and analytics infrastructure to support data	science (Hadoop tools, machine learning libraries, etc.). Follow me on	Twitter here!	I've also worked for Cloudera:	In 2009, I was responsible for helping them build out	a training	and certification program; in fact, I wrote their very first	certification exam!	Interesting tidbit: Friedrich Leibniz was	my (grand-14)advisor.	Contact Information	Jimmy Lin	David R.
