His research interests are in the neurological mechanisms underlying speech and communication and their use in brain-machine interfaces (BMI). Education Ph.D. , Cognitive and Neural Systems , Boston University B.A. , Philosophy , University of Delaware B.S. , Computer and Information Sciences , University of Delaware Teaching Dr. Brumberg teaches undergraduate and graduate courses involving the neural bases of speech production / motor control (SPLH 462) and speech perception (AUD 816). He also mentors undergraduate students in the university research experience program in speech-language-hearing, and electrical engineering and computer science. Teaching Interests Speech science Neuroscience Neuroimaging Speech perception Research Dr. Brumberg is interested in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production, through electrophysiological and behavioral studies. He currently directs an NIH funded research program to develop brain-machine interfaces for control of augmentative and alternative communication devices using electroencephalography (EEG). He is also interested in studying the role of interactive computer programs and interfaces in speech research and rehabilitation, specifically those employing artificial speech synthesis for studying speech production in speakers with and without impairment.
