My most recent work is in formal analysis of robot programs. I am interested in the principles of perceptual systems that combine diverse channels of information about the robot and its environment in the service of behaviors such as target tracking, navigation, wayfinding and exploration. I conduct work in both the theoretical and experimental aspects of this problem domain. My approach is influenced by Arbib's perceptual and motor schema theory, by behavior-based systems as pioneered by Brooks, and by hybrid deliberative-reactive systems as championed by Arkin. A significant portion of my work has been the formal analysis of plans and programs using the techniques of static analysis and Bayesian networks. I work in the Fordham Robotics and Computer Vision (FRCV) Lab and my previous and current projects are described there. Currently I'm involved in the following: Performance guarantees for probabilistic robot systems: Joint work with Ron Arkin of Georgia Tech developing software to establish performance guarantees for probabilistic robot control algorithms using GATech`s MissionLab and Process Algebra based formal models of robot programs funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Multilingual Static Analysis: Leveraging some of the static analysis techniques developed for DTRA, this work addresses open-source analysis tools for software written in multiple, mutually calling languages. This is funded by Bloomberg Corporation NYC. Stereovision-based Visual Homing: An algorithm that incorporates of stereodepth into bioinspired visual homing, and construction and use of stereo databases to allow extensive testing of such algorithms. I am especially interested in how cluster and parallel computation can be applied to robot software architectures and algorithms, using the Fordham CIS 144 core HPC cluster machine.
