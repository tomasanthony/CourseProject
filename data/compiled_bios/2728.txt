 Dominik Wojtczak I am a lecturer at the University of Liverpool and a primary member of the Verification Group . I am also affiliated with the Automata, Computability and Complexity Theory Group as well as the Economics and Computation Group . I graduated with a PhD from the University of Edinburgh at the beginning of 2009 and worked that year as a postdoc at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. After that I was an EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford and a member of the Quantitative Analysis and Verification group.
