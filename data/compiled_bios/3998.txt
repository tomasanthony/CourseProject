 Kristen Grauman Professor Department of Computer Science University of Texas at Austin CV Publications Code Data Short Bio Press I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, where I lead the UT-Austin Computer Vision Group. I was elected to the Academy of Distinguished Teachers at UT Austin in 2017. I received my Ph.D. from MIT in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2006. ML@UT : UT Austin has broad and deep expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence, spanned by groups across several departments on campus.

In general, the goal of computer vision is to develop the algorithms and representations that will allow a computer to autonomously analyze visual information. My primary interests are visual recognition and visual search. Recent and ongoing projects in the group consider large-scale image/video retrieval, unsupervised visual discovery, active learning, active recognition, first-person "egocentric" computer vision, interactive machine learning, image and video segmentation, activity recognition, vision and language, and video summarization.
