 Mohsen Khadem Lecturer in Robotics Institute for Perception, Action and Behaviour School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Email: mohsen.khadem@ed.ac.uk Address: Room 144.A, Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, U.K. Lab Website Background I joined the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in 2018. Previously I was a Post- Doctoral Researcher at the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London. I recieved my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Alberta, Canada in 2017, my M.Sc. in Biomechanics from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2013, and my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Shiraz University, Iran, in 2010. Research My research interests are in surgical robotics and image-guided therapies. My research typically focuses on the clinical problem first, and work with surgeon collaborators to determine the best devices and theoretical approaches to solve it, which may be new robots or novel algorithms. Our projects typically involve the design and modelling of robotic systems for less invasive and/or more accurate surgery, developing control strategies for inner body manipulation of the surgical robots, and fusing image guidance to help the surgeon perform surgery more accurately. My main research topics are: Surgical Robotics and Image-guided Therapies Continuum and Flexible Robots Mechanics-based Modeling and Simulation Applications of Control Theory in Robotics Publications Recent publications are listed here .
