He published 320 refereed journal and conference papers and holds 24 granted patents and patent applications. He licensed numerous patents to USA and Singapore-based companies. He secured over $20M competitive research grant in the past few years. As a leading scientist in BCI field, he delivered more than 60 keynote speeches and invited talks (including the keynote, Brain-Computer Interfaces for Stroke Rehabilitation, at the opening ceremony of the 7th International BCI Meeting, Asilomar, USA, May 2018). He is a recipient of the Annual BCI Research Award, the IES Prestigious Engineering Achievement Award, Achiever of the Year (Research) Award, Finalist of President Technology Award, and winner of BCI Competitions. He played a leadership role in establishing medical technology research and development in A*STAR. He was the A*STAR MedTech Program Leader of Neuro-Technology to lead and coordinate the neuro-technology effort at A*STAR. He initiated and co-established the Rehabilitation Research Institute of Singapore (RRIS) an initiative between A*STAR, NTU, and National Health Group. He established medical research at the Institute of Infocomm Research including founding and directing the I2R Brain-Computer Interface Lab, the Neural & Biomedical Technology Department, and two sizeable medical-technology research programs (with a strength of 60-80). Under his leadership, his group licensed technologies to 10 companies, led to 3 start-up companies and 2 spin-off companies. Their licensees raised over $65M fund collectively. Highlights of his research achievements: o Robust Brain-computer Interface algorithms for motor imagery (FBCSP, regularization, session-to-session adaptation, channel selection, etc.) o Asynchronous and adaptive P300 BCI and its use in wheelchair control o fNIRS based Brain-computer interfaces o Brain-computer Interface for stroke rehabilitation with significant clinical outcome o Innovative system for the treatment of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) in children with significant efficacy outcome o Effective cognitive training for elderly with MCI or ARCD o Novel use of BCI technologies in, for example, sleep, depression, anxiety Appointments, Committee Members and Editorial Board Members: o Co-Director, Rehabilitation Research Institute of Singapore (RRIS), 2015-2018 o Co-Director, NTU-NNI Neurotechnology Fellowship Program, 2017 - o A*STAR MedTech Program Leader of Neuro-Technology, 2010-2016 o Founding Department Head, Neural and Biomedical Technology, Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, 2012-2016 o Founding Program Manager of AIM and INSPECH, large programs focusing on medical and healthcare research and development, 2007-2012 o Principal Scientist (RSE 6), Institute for Infocomm Research, A*SATR o Department Manager, Institute for Infocomm Research, 2005-2007 o Lab Head, NeuroInformatics , Institute for Infocomm Research, 2003-2004 o Director, Research & Development, InfoTalk Technology Pte Ltd, Singapore, 2001 - 2003 o Research Manager, Lernout & Hauspie Asia Pacific, Singapore, 1999 - 2001 o Chief Scientist, Neeuro Pte Ltd, Singapore, 2017 o Chair, Neuro-Technology Subpanel, and Member of National Taskforce on Neurological & Sense Disorders, appointed by HBMS EXCO, 2016-2017 o Member, National Medical Research Council Open Fund IRG Review Panel, MOH, Singapore, 2016 - o Member, A*STAR Biomedical Engineering Program (BEP) Fund Review Panel, 2013 - 2015 o Member, SERC PSF Fund Technical Review Panel, 2014 o Site Miner for A*STAR Biomedical Engineering Program & Take Force for SERC e-Health Program, 2005-2012, 2015-2016 o Advisory Board, Elite Master Program in Neuroengineering , Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM), Germany, 2017 - o Chairman, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Chapter, Singapore Section, 2010-2012 o President, Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence Association (PREMIA), Singapore, 2008-2010 o Associate Editor, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering ( http://tbme.embs.org/ ) o Associate Editor, Brain Computer Interfaces ( http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tbci20 ) o Associate Editor, Frontiers in Neuroscience ( http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/neuroscience ) o Associate Editor, IEEE Access ( http://ieeeaccess.ieee.org ) o Associate Editor, A*STAR Research Publication ( http://www.research.a-star.edu.sg/ ) o Guest-Editor, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2016 o General Co-Chair, IEEE International Conference on Ageless Ageing, 28-30 Jul, 2018, Singapore o IEEE Fellow Evaluation Committee for EMBS Society, 2018 o Vice-Chair, Program Committee, International Conference on Real-time Functional Imaging and Neurofeedback, 29 Nov -1 Dec 2017, Nara, Japan. o International Program Committee, 8 th IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering, May 25-28, 2017, Shanghai, China o Program Committee & Invited Speaker, International Winter Conference on Brain-Computer Interface, 2013-2017, Korea o Conference Chair, Internet of Things (IoT) Asia 2015 Conference & Exhibition, 8-9 April 2015, Singapore o General Chair, IEEE 10th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Application & Services, 2008 o International Program Committee, IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering, 2013-2015 o International Scientific Committee, IEEE EMBS Summer School on Neural Engineering, 2013-2015 o Co-Chair, Emerging Technology, ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA, Nov 2012 o Area Chair, IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), 2008 Awards and Recognitions: o Elevated to IEEE Fellow, Class of 2018 (Citation: for contributions to brain-computer interfaces and applications ) o APSIPA Distinguished Lecturer, 2017-2018 o Finalist of President Technology Award, Singapore, 2014 (for contributions to BCI technologies and medical applications) o Achiever of the Year (Research) Award, Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, 2011 o The Annual BCI Research Award (Top Winner), USA, 2010 (for contributions to BCI for stroke rehabilitation). o IES Prestigious Engineering Achievement Award, 2009 (for contributions to the development of BCI technology and its applications). o Top winner of International BCI Competition IV, 3 EEG categories, 2008 o Top winner of International BCI Competition III, Dataset IIIa, 2005 o Samsung Digital Hope Award, 2004 (to recognize the development of Brainy Communicator)
