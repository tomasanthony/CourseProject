The Pinpoint paper has been accepted by PLDI 2018. You can play with this simple online version . Congratulations to Yepeng Liu for joining the CS faculty of SUSTech. Jeff's research received PLDI 2013 Distinguished Paper Award, nominated by SIGPLAN as CACM Research Highlights! , and won ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award! Our context-sensitive points-to technique has been adopted by the Soot project . Research My general reseach interest centers around the use of both static and dynamic programm analysis techniques for making complex software systems more secure and reliable. Below are the representative publications: The Pinpoint project has been the major research activity of my group for the past three years. The core idea has now been accepted by PLDI 2018. And there is an online demo . You can read the following the paper to get a basic understanding: Qingkai Shi, Xiao Xiao, Rongxin Wu, Jinguo Zhou, Fan Gang and Charles Zhang Pinpoint: Fast and Precise Sparse Value Flow Analysis for Million Lines of Code . In PLDI 2018 : the 39th annual ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation. Philadelphia, USA, June, 2018 Pinpoint is being commercialized by Sourcebrella . Casper is the first ever POPL paper from Hong Kong and the idea is both clever and practical. For instance, Rongxin, the first author has applied the idea to solve debugging problems for the WeChat devlopment team. Rongxin Wu, Xiao Xiao, Shing-Chi Cheung, Hongyu Zhang and Charles Zhang. Casper: An Efficient Approach to Call Trace Collection . In POPL 2016 : 43rd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, St. Petersburg, Florida, January 2016. ( paper ) This invited paper by JCST summarizes well the core dynamic anlaysis work we did, including LEAP (FSE2010), PECAN(ISSTA 2011), LEAN(OOPSLA 2012), and CLAP(PLDI 2013), for finding errors in multithreaded programs. Jeff Huang and Charles Zhang . Debugging Concurrent Software: Advances and Challenges . In Journal of Computer Science and Technology, Vol. 31 (5): 861-868, 2016 ( Invited ) The CLAP paper is the first ever paper award by PLDI to an Asian university and I am very pround of it. Jeff is now a professor at Texas A&M University. ( SIGPLAN PLDI Distinguished Paper Award, Nominated for CACM Research Highlights ) Jeff Huang, Charles Zhang and Julian Dolby CLAP: Recording Local Executions to Reproduce Concurrency Failures .
