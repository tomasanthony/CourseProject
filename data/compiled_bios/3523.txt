Biography He received his M, 1961 and Ph.D., 1964 degrees from the MIT and the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, respectively. He became an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in 1964, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1967. He joined the UC Berkeley in 1970. He is the first recipient of the 2005 Gustav Kirchhoff Award, the highest IEEE Technical Field Award for outstanding contributions to the fundamentals of any aspect of electronic circuits and systems that has a long term significance or impact. He was also awarded the prestigious IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award in 2000 for his contributions in neural networks. He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 1974 and has received many international prizes, including the IEEE Browder J. Thompson Memorial Prize in 1972, the IEEE W. R. G. Baker Prize in 1978, the Frederick Emmons Award in 1974, the M. E. Van Valkenhurg Award in 1995, and again in 1998. He was awarded 7 USA patents and 8 Honorary doctorates (Doctor Honoris Causa) from major European universities and Japan. He is also a recipient of the top 15 cited authors in Engineering award in 2002, chosen from the Current Contents (ISI) database of all cited papers in the engineering disciplines in the citation index from 1991 to October 31, 2001, from all branches of engineering. He was elected a foreign member of the European Academy of Sciences (Academia Europea) in 1997. . . Selected Publications R. Lum and L. O.
