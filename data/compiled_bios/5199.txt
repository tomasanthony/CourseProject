 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING Victoria Kostina About Me I joined Caltech as an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering in the fall of 2014. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Sergio Verd . I completed my PhD at Princeton University in September 2013. I spent the spring of 2015 as a Research Fellow at Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing . I hold a Bachelor's degree from Moscow institute of Physics and Technology , where I was affiliated with the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and a Master's degree from University of Ottawa . I received the 2013Princeton Electrical Engineering Best Dissertation Award and the 2017 NSF CAREER award . My research interests lie in information theory, theory of random processes, coding, wireless communications, and control. I am particularly interested in fundamental limits of delay-sensitive communications . Curriculum Vitae Openings I am looking for strong students and postdocs to join my research group. Prospective students: I apologize I am unable to respond to all inquiries please do apply online and mention my name as a possible research advisor. I supervise students from the Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) , Control and Dynamical Systems (CDS) , and Electrical Engineering (EE) PhD programs. Prospective postdocs: please apply through the Center for the Mathematics of Information (CMI) postdoctoral fellowship program and mention my name in the application. Research Preprints V.

Matlab Toolbox SPECTRE: Short Packet Communication Toolbox provides numerical routines to compute bounds and approximations for some popular channel and source models in finite blocklength information theory. Teaching EE 167: Introduction to Data Compression and Storage Spring 2017 The course will introduce the students to the basic principles and techniques of codes for data compression and storage. The students will master the basic algorithms used for lossless and lossy compression of digital and analog data and the major ideas behind coding for flash memories. Topics include the Huffman code, the arithmetic code, Lempel-Ziv dictionary techniques, scalar and vector quantizers, transform coding; codes for constrained storage systems. Prerequisites: Ma 3 or ACM 116. EE/Ma/CS 127: Error-Correcting Codes Winter 2016, Winter 2017, Fall 2017, Winter 2019 Prerequisites: Ma 2. This course develops from first principles the theory and practical implementation of the most important techniques for combating errors in digital transmission or storage systems. Topics include algebraic block codes, e.g., Hamming, BCH, Reed-Solomon (including a self-contained introduction to the theory of finite fields); and the modern theory of sparse graph codes with iterative decoding, e.g., LDPC codes, turbo codes. The students will become acquainted with encoding and decoding algorithms, design principles, and performance evaluation of codes. EE 120: Topics in Information Theory Spring 2016, Spring 2018 This class introduces information measures such as entropy, information divergence, mutual information, information density from a probabilistic point of view, and discusses the relations of those quantities to problems in data compression and transmission, statistical inference, language modeling, game theory, and control. Topics include information projection, data processing inequalities, sufficient statistics, hypothesis testing, single-shot approach in information theory, large deviations. Prerequisites: undergraduate calculus and probability; desirable but not required: EE 126. EE 150: Nonasymptotic Information Theory Fall 2014 Delay-constrained theory of information: single-shot results, information spectrum methods. Information-theoretic limits for sources and channels with memory and/or general alphabets. Advantages of variable-length, feedback, and joint source-channel coding in the nonasymptotic regime.
