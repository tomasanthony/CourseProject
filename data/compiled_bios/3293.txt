 Steven Wu Assistant Professor Computer Science & Engineering Department University of Minnesota Email: zsw [at] umn.edu 6-225E Keller Hall 200 Union Street SE Minneapolis, MN 55455 My name is Zhiwei Steven Wu. I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota in the Computer Science & Engineering Department . I spent a year as a post-doctoral researcher at Microsoft Research-New York City . Before that, I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania , where I was extremely fortunate to have been co-advised by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth . I am broadly interested in algorithms and machine learning, especially in the areas of privacy-preserving data analysis, fairness in machine learning, and algorithmic economics. My CV can be found here . I am currently looking for self-motivated and mathematically mature PhD students! News Feb, 2019 - I won the J.P. Morgan Faculty Research Award! Jan, 2019 - I am in Berkeley for the Simons Institute Semester on Data Privacy ! Jan, 2019 - One paper accepted at WWW'19. December, 2018 - With Haiyi Zhu, we received the Facebook Research Award on Mechanism Design for Social Good! October, 2018 - One paper accepted at FAT*'19. September, 2018 - Our paper on a smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem was accepted for a spotlight at NIPS'18. July, 2018 - I will be serving as a Statistic/ML track chair at FAT* 2019 . Submit your best work! Manuscripts (Unless specified otherwise, authors are listed in alphabetical order.)
