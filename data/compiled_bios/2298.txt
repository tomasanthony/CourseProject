In contrast to "theoretical" or fundamental research, my team has been working closely with companies to study and develop novel, distributed and deployment-ready systems which advance the field. We apply rigorous algorithmic and optimization techniques to relentlessly close practice-theory gaps so that our systems operate under the most general and realistic network environment. The systems we developed are not simply proof-of-concept prototypes, but can be fully integrated into industrial operations with unmatched performance in their running. I keep a strong team of researchers (postdocs, PhD and MPhil candidates) and regular engineering staff, whose work closely knit together so that our research results drive engineering excellence while deployment challenges drive our research agenda. Our work has been extensively supported by leading companies such as Boeing, China Mobile, Cisco, Google, HAECO, HP, Huawei, Modern Terminals Ltd. (HK), Mei Ah Entertainment, Microsoft, TCL, Tencent, etc. Widely known for their practical nature, my projects have won several awards and been of direct impact to industry. They have been demonstrated and deployed with remarkable success. The following lists some of my research projects which have been or are being transferred to companies with commercial users (mostly supported by industry-government collaboration program through Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) and LSCM Center ): SmartAP: Ubiquitous people sensing and user analytics Highlights China College Students' Entrepreneurship Competition (Silver Medal), 2018 International Exhibition of Inventions (Silver Medal), Geneva, April 2018 Hong Kong ICT Awards (Bronze), Student Innovation (Tertiary or Above), 2018 Champion, JCI East Kowloon Next Step Startup Challenge, July 2017 Student Team Award, Winner of the 7th Annual HKUST One Million Dollar Entrepreneurship Competition, June 2017 First-class Award, Entrepreneurship Proposal, "Challenge Cup" National Competition - Hong Kong Regional Final, Hong Kong University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition 2017, May 2017 Collaborative industry-government fundings Trial: Smart AP: Wi-Fi positioning and optimization for a smart city (Total HK$2,489,750.00) Smart AP: Wi-Fi positioning and optimization for a smart city (Total HK$8,814,651.58) Wherami: Client-based indoor localization technology Highlights Hong Kong Awards for Industries: Technological Achievement, 2018 (To Compathnion Technology Ltd. for deploying our technologies) HK ICT Awards 2018 (Certificate of Merit), Smart Mobility Award (Smart Tourism), 2018 (To Harbour City Estates Ltd./Compathnion Technology Ltd. for deploying our technologies) Hong Kong Awards for Industries: Innovation and Creativity, 2015 (To Compathnion Technology Ltd. for deploying our technologies) Try out our android apps for HKUST multi-floor campus on Google Play Collaborative industry-government fundings Trial: Indoor localization, tracking and navigation (Total HK$1,674,000.00) Indoor localization, tracking and navigation (Total HK$11,206,191.59) Lavinet: An advanced multi-hop wireless infrastructure for pervasive and high-throughput Wi-Fi access Highlights Asia-Pacific ICT Awards (Merit), Research and Development category, Brunei, December 2012 Best Innovation & Research (College & Undergraduates) Award (Bronze), Hong Kong ICT Awards 2012 Silver Award, Boeing Research and Technology, 2009 Successful technology transfer and commercial deployment in Modern Terminals Ltd.
