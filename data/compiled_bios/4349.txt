We are delighted to invite you to come to New York, one of the most exciting cities of the world, and take part in IJCAI, the leading conference on the thrilling field of Artificial Intelligence. AI today has a tremendous impact. It is in all the media and makes a real difference. At IJCAI-16, you will have the opportunity to meet some of the world's leading AI researchers, to learn first-hand about their newest research results and developments, and to catch up with current AI trends in science and industry. And, of course, IJCAI-16 will be the perfect forum for presenting your own achievements, both to specialists in your field, and to the AI world in general. In addition to the presentation of 551 technical papers (selected from the largest ever pool of submissions to IJCAI), the conference will include tutorials , workshops , demonstrations , invited talks , sister conferences best paper talks and early career spotlight talks . On Friday afternoon, IJCAI will have an AI Festival featuring talks from IJCAI award winners (this session will be open to the public). Friday will also feature an industry day . The theme of this year's conference is Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence--we will have technical paper sessions, invited talks and panels organized around this theme, and focusing on the many benefits of AI systems working in collaboration with humans.  Online schedule The conference (including workshops and tutorials) will be held at the Hilton in midtown Manhattan. The Hilton is just a ten-minute walk from Central Park, where the conference banquet will be held, and half a block from the world-famous Museum of Modern Art, where we will hold the opening reception. Times Square, the Broadway theater district, the Empire State Building and many other famous tourist attractions are all in walking distance --- an extra reason to join us and to add a couple of days to your visit. So, mark the dates on your calendar and start thinking about which papers to submit and which systems to demonstrate. If you work for a company consider taking advantage of the exhibition opportunities IJCAI-16 will provide. And if you are a potential sponsor please check our sponsorship brochure. The visibility you will get by sponsoring IJCAI-16 will be hard to match. Looking forward to meeting you in New York! The IJCAI-16 Conference Committee.     Proceedings are online!

Guanajuato, Mxico.  The sixth Pacific-Rim Symposium on Image and Video Technology ( PSIVT 2013 ) has been held in Guanajuato, Mxico, from October 28th to November 1st, 2013.  PSIVT provides a forum for presenting and exploring the newest research and development in image and video technology by discussing the possibilities and directions in this field, and a place where both academic research and industrial activities are presented and meet for mutual benefit. It invites researchers, artists, developers, educators, performers, and practitioners of image and video technology from the Pacific Rim and around the world.   The PSIVT 2013 proceedings of the main conference and workshops will be published by Springer-Verlag as volumes 8333 and 8334 in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science collection.   Selected and extended papers, such as the award winning papers, will be invited to be published in a Journal Publication to be announced soon.   High-quality contributions from prospective authors were solicited in all aspects of image and video technology including, but not limited to:   Imaging and Graphics Hardware and Visualization  Image/Video Coding and Transmission  Image/Video Processing and Analysis  Image/Video Retrieval and Scene Understanding  Applications of Image and Video Technology  Biomedical Image Processing and Analysis  Biometrics and Image Forensics  Computational Photography and Arts  Computer and Robot Vision  Pattern Recognition  Video Surveillance   All papers were subject to a double-blind review process which was be carried out by at least three experienced researchers in the field, supervised by area chairs, also including a brief rebuttal at the end of the decision process. (As a guide: Previous issues of PSIVT all had an acceptance rate of about 40 percent.) Details on paper submission can be found in the authors page.
