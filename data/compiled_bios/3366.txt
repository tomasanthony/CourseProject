 Home Papers Talks Lab Blog Seny Kamara Associate Professor, Brown University Lab: Encrypted Systems Lab ( blog) email: seny@brown.edu twitter: @senykam pub key: B80B 84AC 9C5D 174D Overview I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brown University . Before joining Brown, I was a researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond Lab). My research is in cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy, security and surveillance. My primary focus is on the design and cryptanalysis of encrypted algorithms, which are efficient algorithms that operate on end-to-end encrypted data. I maintain interests in various aspects of theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data structures and algorithms, data systems, algorithmic fairness, game theory and technology policy. I direct the Encrypted Systems Lab and am a member of the CAPS group.
