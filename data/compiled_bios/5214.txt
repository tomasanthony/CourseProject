Housner Professor of Engineering and Applied Science Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering Home People Research Courses CV Publications Links Contacts My Research Interests In preparation for my shift to Professor Emeritus at the California Institute of Technology next year, I am no longer accepting graduate students into my research group. I will continue to collaborate with others on research of mutual interest. My research is focused primarily on the dynamics of structural systems where we are interested in dynamic response prediction, model identification and structural health monitoring from vibrational data, and control of vibrational response. To improve performance-based earthquake-resistant design, we are also interested in modeling and predicting earthquake loads, damage and monetary losses (repair costs and income loss) that a structure may experience during its lifetime. A characteristic feature of much of our research is that it involves a probability logic approach to handle the uncertainties involved in structural modeling and excitation modeling. Recent research topics include: robust response prediction and reliability, structural health monitoring, seismic loss estimation, seismic early warning, stochastic robust structural control, Bayesian updating and model class selection using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation methods, Bayesian state and parameter estimation using particle filter methods, and sparse Bayesian learning with automatic relevence determination prior.
