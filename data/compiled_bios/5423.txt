 Helen Pain's Personal Page RESEARCH INTERESTS: My research interests include supporting learning and communication in children with special needs, through adaptive multi-media technology; modelling social intelligence and communication in interactions with pedagogical agents; affective and cognitive modelling of learners; participatory and user-centred design and evaluation of interfaces, and empirical methodology. The central elements of my approach are that it is both tool-based and empirically informed, theoretically motivated and involves stakeholders in the design and evaluation process. A major goal of this work is to develop interactive learning environments and communication tools that engage and support learners in play and exploration.
