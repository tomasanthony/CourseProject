Research Overview In the last two decades, there has been a fundamental shift in the design of computer systems. Despite continued device scaling as predicted by Moores Law, building larger and faster single-processor chips has become increasingly difficult due to the power consumption of these systems. Concerns about power consumption have held clock frequencies relatively steady in recent years (compared to the increases enjoyed through the 1990s). Architects are now exploiting growing transistor counts to integrate multiple cores per chip in order to provide increased performance with every new technology generation. In this computing landscape, computation is essentially free; we can build as many arithmetic and logic units (ALUs) as we would like. Despite the ability to integrate an astounding amount of computation on to a chip, we face a number of key challenges. First, doubling the number the compute resources in the form of more cores does not navely result in a doubling of performance. Communication remains a bottleneck to extracting more performance from these systems. Communication is needed in these architectures to feed computational units with data (both from off-chip memory and from other areas on the chip) and to maintain a coherent view of globally shared memory. Second, power consumption remains a significant concern and growing transistor counts have lead to the era of Dark Silicon. Dark Silicon is an operating paradigm in which chips have more transistors than can be simultaneously switched on and off due to power and thermal limitations. To address these challenges, my research group continues to work in on-chip interconnects but has also expanded to make research contributions to energy-efficient design through approximate computing and hardware acceleration to mitigate the impacts of dark silicon.

This work is designed to be a short synthesis of the most critical concepts in on-chip network design. It is a resource for both understanding on-chip network basics and for providing an overview of state of-the-art research in on-chip networks. We believe that an overview that teaches both fundamental concepts and highlights state-of-the-art designs will be of great value to both graduate students and industry engineers. While not an exhaustive text, we hope to illuminate fundamental concepts for the reader as well as identify trends and gaps in on-chip network research. With the rapid advances in this field, we felt it was timely to update and review the state of the art in this second edition. We introduce two new chapters at the end of the book. We have updated the latest research of the past years throughout the book and also expanded our coverage of fundamental concepts to include several research ideas that have now made their way into products and, in our opinion, should be textbook concepts that all on-chip network practitioners should know. For example, these fundamental concepts include message passing, multicast routing, and bubble flow control schemes.

On-chip networks seek to provide a scalable and high-bandwidth communication substrate for multi-core and many-core architectures. High bandwidth and low latency within the on-chip network must be achieved while fitting within tight area and power budgets.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Energy-harvesting deviceswhich operate solely on energy collected from their environmenthave brought forth a new paradigm of intermittent computing. These devices succumb to frequent power outages that would cause conventional systems to be stuck in a perpetual loop of restarting computation and never making progress. Ensuring forward progress in an intermittent execution model requires saving state in nonvolatile memory (backup) and potentially re-executing from the last saved state upon a power loss (restore). The interplay between spending energy on useful processing and spending energy on these necessary overheads yield unexpected trade-offs. To facilitate early design space exploration, the field of intermittent computing requires better models for 1) generalizing and reasoning about these trade-offs and 2) helping architects and programmers in making early-stage design decisions. We propose the EH model, which characterizes an intermittent systems ability to maximize how much of its available energy is spent on useful processor execution. The model parametrizes the energy costs associated with intermittent execution to allow an intuitive understanding of how forward progress can change. We use the EH model to explore how forward progress is impacted with the frequency of backups and the energy cost of backups and restores. We validate the EH model with hardware measurements on an MSP430 and characterize its parameters via simulation. We also demonstrate how architects and programmers can use the model to explore the design space of intermittent processors, derive insights, and model new optimizations that are unique to intermittent processor architectures.

Nevertheless, the sporadic packet arrivals compromise the effectiveness of power-gating by incurring significant latency and energy overhead. In this paper, we propose a Scalable Pivot-based On/Off Gating Engine (SPONGE) which efficiently manages power-gating decisions and routing mechanism by adaptively selecting a small set of powered-on columns of routers and keeping the others in power-gated state. To this end, a router architecture augmented with a novel routing algorithm is proposed in which a packet can traverse powered-off routers without waking them up, and can only turn in predetermined powered-on routers. Experimental results on SPLASH-2 benchmarks demonstrate that, compared to the conventional power-gating method, SPONGE on average not only improves static power consumption by 81.7%, it also improves average packet latency by 63%.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : System-on-Chip (SoC) complexity and the increasing costs of silicon motivate the breaking of an SoC into smaller chiplets. A chiplet-based SoC design process has the promise to enable fast SoC construction by using advanced packaging technologies to tightly integrate multiple disparate chips (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory, FPGA). However, when assembling chiplets into a single SoC, correctness validation becomes a significant challenge. In particular, the network-on-chip (NoC) used within the individual chiplets and across chiplets to tie them together can easily have deadlocks, especially if each chip is designed in isolation. We introduce a simple, modular, yet elegant methodology for ensuring deadlock-free routing in multi-chiplet systems. As an example, we focus on future systems combining chiplets on an active silicon interposer. To maximize modularity, each individual chiplet is free to implement its own NoC topology and local routing algorithm, and the interposer can implement its own independent topology and routing. Our methodology imposes a few simple turn restrictions applied only to traffic as it flows into or out of the chiplets from the interposer, and we provide a way to determine these restrictions. The end result is an overall approach that enables highly-modular, chipletbased SoC construction while eliminating deadlocks with high performance.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Approximate computing is the idea that systems can gain performance and energy efficiency if they expend less effort on producing a "perfect" answer. Approximate computing techniques propose various ways of exposing and exploiting accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. We persent a taxonomy that classifies approximate computing techniques according to salient features: visibility, determinism, and coarseness. These axes allow us to address questions about the correctability, reproducibility, and control over accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs of different techniques. We use this taxonomy to inform research challenges in approximate architectures, compilers, and applications.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : This work investigates how using reduced precision data in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) affects network accuracy during classification. We observe that the tolerance of DNNs to reduced precision data not only varies across networks, but also within networks. We study how error tolerance across layers varies and propose a method for finding a low precision configuration for a network while maintaining high accuracy. To exploit these low precision configurations, this work proposes Proteus , which re- duces the data traffic and storage footprint needed by DNNs, resulting in reduced energy for DNN implementations. Proteus uses a different representation per layer for both the data (neuron activations) and the weights (synapses) processed by DNNs. Proteus is a layered extension over existing DNN implementations that maintains the native precision of the compute engine by converting to and from a fixed-point reduced precision format used in memory. Proteus uses a novel memory layout, enabling a simple, low-cost and low-energy conversion unit. We evaluate Proteus as an extension to a state-of-the-art accelerator [1] which uses a uniform 16-bit fixed-point representation. On five popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and during inference Proteus reduces data traffic by 43% on average while main- taining accuracy within 1% compared to the full precision baseline. As a result, Proteus improves energy by 15% with no performance loss.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : The cost of moving and storing data is still a fundamental concern for computer architects. Inefficient handling of data can be attributed to conventional architectures being oblivious to the nature of the values that these data bits carry. We observe the phenomenon of spatio-value similarity, where data elements that are approximately similar in value exhibit spatial regularity in memory. This is inherent to 1) the data values of real-world applications, and 2) the way we store data structures in memory. We propose the Bunker Cache, a design that maps similar data to the same cache storage location based solely on their memory address, sacrificing some application quality loss for greater efficiency. The Bunker Cache enables performance gains (ranging from 1.08x to 1.19x) via reduced cache misses and energy savings (ranging from 1.18x to 1.39x) via reduced off-chip memory accesses and lower cache storage requirements. The Bunker Cache requires only modest changes to cache indexing hardware, integrating easily into commodity systems.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : This work observes that a large fraction of the computations performed by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are intrinsically ineffectual as they involve a multiplication where one of the inputs is zero. This observation motivates Cnvlutin (CNV), a value-based approach to hardware acceleration that eliminates most of these ineffectual operations, improving performance and energy over a state-of-the-art accelerator with no accuracy loss. CNV uses hierarchical data-parallel units, allowing groups of lanes to proceed mostly independently enabling them to skip over the ineffectual computations. A co-designed data storage format encodes the computation elimination decisions taking them off the critical path while avoiding control divergence in the data parallel units. Combined, the units and the data storage format result in a data-parallel architecture that maintains wide, aligned accesses to its memory hierarchy and that keeps its data lanes busy. By loosening the ineffectual computation identification criterion, CNV enables further performance and energy efficiency improvements, and more so if a loss in accuracy is acceptable. Experimental measurements over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs for image classification show that CNV improves performance over a state-of-the-art accelerator from 1.24x to 1.55x and by 1.37x on average without any loss in accuracy by removing zero-valued operand multiplications alone. While CNV incurs an area overhead of 4.49%, it improves overall EDP (Energy Delay Product) and ED^2P (Energy Delay Squared Product) on average by 1.47x and 2.01x, respectively. The average performance improvements increase to 1.52x without any loss in accuracy with a broader ineffectual identification policy. Further improvements are demonstrated with a loss in accuracy.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm enabling tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. However, a fundamental challenge persists: state-of-the-art techniques lack the ability to enforce runtime guarantees on accuracy. The convention is to 1) employ offline or online accuracy models, or 2) present experimental results that demonstrate empirically low error. Unfortunately, these approaches are still unable to guarantee acceptability of all application outputs at runtime. We offer a solution that revisits concepts from anytime algorithms. Originally explored for real-time decision problems, anytime algorithms have the property of producing results with increasing accuracy over time. We propose the Anytime Automaton, a new computation model that executes applications as a parallel pipeline of anytime approximations. An automaton produces approximate versions of the application output with increasing accuracy, guaranteeing that the final precise version is eventually reached. The automaton can be stopped whenever the output is deemed acceptable; otherwise, it is a simple matter of letting it run longer. We present an in-depth analysis of the model and demonstrate attractive runtime-accuracy profiles on various applications. Our anytime automaton is the first step towards systems where the acceptability of an application's output directly governs the amount of time and energy expended.

This flexibility enables improvements over conventional DNN implementations that use a single, uniform representation. This work proposes Proteus, which reduces the data traffic and storage footprint needed by DNNs, resulting in reduced energy and improved area efficiency for DNN implementations. Proteus uses a different representation per layer for both the data (neurons) and the weights (synapses) processed by DNNs. Proteus is a layered extension over existing DNN implementations that converts between the numerical representation used by the DNN execution engines and the shorter, layer-specific fixed-point representation used when reading and writing data values to memory be it on-chip buffers or off-chip memory. Proteus uses a novel memory layout for DNN data, enabling a simple, low-cost and low-energy conversion unit. We evaluate Proteus as an extension to a state-of-the-art accelerator [7] which uses a uniform 16-bit fixed-point representation. On five popular DNNs Proteus reduces data traffic among layers by 43% on average while maintaining accuracy within 1% even when compared to a single precision floating-point implementation. As a result, Proteus improves energy by 15% with no performance loss. Proteus also reduces the data footprint by at least 38% and hence the amount of on-chip buffering needed resulting in an implementation that requires 20% less area overall. This area savings can be used to improve cost by building smaller chips, to process larger DNNs for the same on-chip area, or to incorporate an additional three execution engines increasing peak performance bandwidth by 18%.

Loh In IEEE MICRO Top Picks from Computer Architecture (to appear) , 2016. [ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Silicon interposers enable the integration of multiple stacks of in-package memory to provide higher bandwidth or lower energy for memory accesses. Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new opportunities to exploit the interposer. In this work, we exploit the interposer to "disintegrate" a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that collectively cost less to manufacture than a single large chip. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of interposer-based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new interposer network-on-chip (NoC) organizations to mitigate the performance challenges while preserving the cost benefits. While this work focuses on NoC support for disintegrated systems, it paves the way for a range of new research problems in interposer-based disintegrated systems.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : The interconnect or network on chip (NoC) is an increasingly important component in processors. As systems scale up in size and functionality, the ability to efficiently model larger and more complex NoCs becomes increasingly important to the design and evaluation of such systems. Recent work proposed the "SynFull" methodology that performs statistical analysis of a workload's NoC traffic to create compact traffic generators based on Markov models. While the models generate synthetic traffic, the traffic is statistically similar to the original trace and can be used for fast NoC simulation. However, the original SynFull work only evaluated multi-core CPU scenarios with a very simple cache coherence protocol (MESI). We find the original SynFull methodology to be insufficient when modeling the NoC of a more complex system on a chip (SoC). We identify and analyze the shortcomings of SynFull in the context of a SoC consisting of a heterogeneous architecture (CPU and GPU), a more complex cache hierarchy including support for full coherence between CPU, GPU, and shared caches, and heterogeneous workloads. We introduce new techniques to ad- dress these shortcomings. Furthermore, the original SynFull methodology can only model a NoC with N nodes when the original application analysis is performed on an identically-sized N-node system, but one typically wants to model larger future systems. Therefore, we introduce new techniques to enable SynFull-like analysis to be extrapolated to model such larger systems. Finally, we present a novel synthetic memory reference model to replace SynFull's fixed latency model; this allows more realistic evaluation of the memory subsystem and its interaction with the NoC. The result is a robust NoC simulation methodology that works for large, heterogeneous SoC architectures.

[ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : With increasing core counts and higher memory de- mands from applications, it is imperative that networks-on-chip (NoCs) provide low-latency, power-efficient communication. Conventional NoCs tend to be over- provisioned for worst-case bandwidth demands leading to ineffective use of network resources and significant power inefficiency; average channel utilization is typically less than 5% in real-world applications. In terms of performance, low-latency techniques often introduce power and area overheads and incur significant complexity in the router microarchitecture. We find that both low latency and power efficiency are possible by relaxing the constraint of lossless communication. This is inspired from internetworking where best effort delivery is commonplace. We propose the Runahead NoC, a lightweight, lossy network that provides single-cycle hops. Allowing for lossy delivery enables an extremely simple bufferless router microarchitecture that performs routing and arbitration within the same cycle as link traversal. The Runahead NoC operates either as a power-saver that is integrated into an existing conventional NoC to improve power efficiency, or as an accelerator that is added on top to provide ultra-low latency communication for select packets. On a range of PARSEC and SPLASH-2 workloads, we find that the Runahead NoC reduces power consumption by 1.81x as a power-saver and improves runtime and packet latency by 1.08x and 1.66x as an accelerator.

Cache designs have improved dramatically by considering reference locality. Data values are also a source of optimization. Compression and deduplication exploit data values to use cache storage more efficiently resulting in smaller caches without sacrificing performance. In multi-megabyte LLCs, many identical or similar values may be cached across multiple blocks simultaneously. This redundancy effectively wastes cache capacity. We observe that a large fraction of cache values exhibit approximate similarity. More specifically, values across cache blocks are not identical but are similar. Coupled with approximate computing which observes that some applications can tolerate error or inexactness, we leverage approximate similarity to design a novel LLC architecture: the Doppelganger cache. The Doppelganger cache associates the tags of multiple similar blocks with a single data array entry to reduce the amount of data stored. Our design achieves 1.55x, 2.55x and 1.41x reductions in LLC area, dynamic energy and leakage energy without harming performance nor incurring high application error.

Loh MICRO-48 Proceedings of the 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture, 2015 frames are not supported [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Silicon interposers enable the integration of multiple stacks of in-package memory to provide higher bandwidth or lower energy for memory accesses. Once the interposer has been paid for, there are new opportunities to exploit the interposer. Recent work considers using the routing resources of the interposer to improve the network-on-chip's (NoC) capabilities. In this work, we exploit the interposer to disintegrate a multi-core CPU chip into smaller chips that individually and collectively cost less to manufacture than a single large chip. However, this fragments the overall NoC, which decreases performance as core-to-core messages between chips must now route through the interposer. We study the performance-cost trade-offs of interposer-based, multi-chip, multi-core systems and propose new interposer NoC organizations to mitigate the performance challenges while preserving the cost benefits.

Loh , Natalie Enright Jerger , Ajaykumar Kannan , Yasuko Eckert MEMSYS '15 Proceedings of the 2015 International Symposium on Memory Systems, 2015 frames are not supported [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Silicon interposer technology is promising for large-scale in- tegration of memory within a processor package. While past work on vertical, 3D-stacked memory allows a stack of memory to be placed directly on top of a processor, the total amount of memory that could be integrated is limited by the size of the processor die. With silicon interposers, multiple memory stacks can be integrated inside the processor package, thereby increasing both the capacity and the bandwidth provided by the 3D memory. However, the full potential of all of this integrated memory may be squandered if the in-package interconnect architecture cannot keep up with the data rates provided by the multiple memory stacks. This position paper describes key issues in providing the interconnect support for aggressive interposer-based memory integration, and argues for additional research efforts to address these challenges to enable integrated memory to deliver its full value.

Efficient DVFS relies on accurate predictions of future network state. Most previous approaches are reactive and based on network-centric metrics, such as buffer occupation and channel utilization. However, we find that there is little correlation between those metrics and subsequent NoC traffic, which leads to suboptimal DVFS decisions. In this work, we propose to utilize highly predictable properties of cache-coherence communication to derive more spe- cific and reliable NoC traffic predictions. A DVFS mechanism based on our traffic predictions, reduces power by 41% compared to a baseline without DVFS and by 21% on average when compared to a state-of-the-art DVFS implementation, while only degrading performance by 3%.

Yet to achieve greater energy efficiency, we argue that it is just as important that data is delivered no earlier than needed. To address this, we explore data criticality in CMPs. Caches fetch data in bulk (blocks of multiple words). Depending on the application's memory access patterns, some words are needed right away (critical) while other data are fetched too soon (non-critical). On a wide range of applications, we perform a limit study of the impact of data criticality in NoC design. Criticality-oblivious designs can waste up to 37.5% energy, compared to an idealized NoC that fetches each word both no later and no earlier than needed. Furthermore, 62.3% of energy is wasted fetching data that is not used by the application. We present NoCNoC, a practical, criticality-aware NoC design that achieves up to 60.5% energy savings with no loss in per- formance. Our work moves towards an ideally-efficient NoC, delivering data both no later and no earlier than needed.

Branch prediction traditionally considers past branch outcomes as a linear, continuous bit stream through which it searches for patterns and correlations. The state-of-the-art TAGE predictor and its variants follow this approach while varying the length of the global history fragments they consider. This work identifies a construct, inherent to several applications that challenges existing, linear history based branch prediction strategies. It finds that applications have branches that exhibit multi-dimensional correlations. These are branches with the following two attributes: 1) they are enclosed within nested loops, and 2) they exhibit correlation across iterations of the outer loops. Folding the branch history and interpreting it as a multidimensional piece of information, exposes these cross-iteration correlations allowing predictors to search for more complex correlations in the history space with lower cost. We present wormhole, a new side-predictor that exploits these multidimensional histories. Wormhole is integrated alongside ISL-TAGE and leverages information from its existing side-predictors. Experiments show that the wormhole predictor improves accuracy more than existing side-predictors, some of which are commercially available, with a similar hardware cost. Considering 40 diverse application traces, the wormhole predictor reduces MPKI by an average of 2.53% and 3.15% on top of 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE predictors respectively. When considering the top four workloads that exhibit multi-dimensional history correlations, Wormhole achieves 22% and 20% MPKI average reductions over 4KB and 32KB ISL-TAGE.

Loh In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-47) [ PDF ] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Silicon interposer technology ("2.5D" stacking) enables the integration of multiple memory stacks with a processor chip, thereby greatly increasing in-package memory capacity while largely avoiding the thermal challenges of 3D stacking DRAM on the processor. Systems employing interposers for memory integration use the interposer to provide point-to-point interconnects between chips. However, these interconnects only utilize a fraction of the interposer's overall routing capacity, and in this work we explore how to take advantage of this otherwise unused resource. We describe a general approach for extending the architecture of a network-on-chip (NoC) to better exploit the additional routing resources of the silicon interposer. We propose an asymmetric organization that distributes the NoC across both a multi-core chip and the interposer, where each sub-network is different from the other in terms of the traffic types, topologies, the use or non-use of concentration, direct vs. indirect network organizations, and other network attributes. Through experimental evaluation, we show that exploiting the otherwise unutilized routing resources of the interposer can lead to significantly better performance.

These applications, which range from multimedia processing to machine learning, operate on inherently noisy and imprecise data. We can trade-off some loss in output value integrity for improved processor performance and energy-efficiency. As memory accesses consume substantial latency and energy, we explore load value approximation , a microarchitectural technique to learn value patterns and generate approximations for the data. The processor uses these approximate data values to continue executing without incurring the high cost of accessing memory, removing load instructions from the critical path. Load value approximation can also inhibit approximated loads from accessing memory, resulting in energy savings. On a range of PARSEC workloads, we observe up to 28.6% speedup (8.5% on average) and 44.1% energy savings (12.6% on average), while maintaining low output error. By exploiting the approximate nature of applications, we draw closer to the ideal latency and energy of accessing memory.

Conventional topologies such as a 2D mesh have drawbacks including high diameter as the network scales and poor load balancing for the center nodes. We propose a methodology to design random topologies for on-chip networks. Random topologies provide better scalability in terms of network diameter and provide inherent load balancing. As a proof-of-concept for random on-chip topologies, we explore a novel set of networks -- dodecs -- and illustrate how they reduce network diameter with randomized low-radix router connections. While a 4x4 mesh has a diameter of 6, our dodec has a diameter of 4 with lower cost. By introducing randomness, dodec networks exhibit more uniform message latency. By using low-radix routers, dodec networks simplify the router microarchitecture and attain 20% area and 22% power reduction compared to mesh routers while delivering the same overall application performance for PARSEC.

While FPGAs are extensively used for packet parsing, inspection and classification, they have seen less use as the switch fabric between network ports. However, recent work has proposed embedding a network-on-chip (NoC) as a new "hard" resource on FPGAs and we show that by properly leveraging such a NoC one can create a very efficient yet still highly programmable network switch. We compare a NoC-based 16x16 network switch for 10-Gigabit Ethernet traffic to a recent innovative FPGA-based switch fabric design. The NoC-based switch not only consumes 5.8% less logic area, but also reduces latency by 8.1%. We also show that using the FPGA's programmable interconnect to adjust the packet injection points into the NoC leads to significant performance improvements. A routing algorithm tailored to this application is shown to further improve switch performance and scalability. Overall, we show that an FPGA with a low-cost hard 64-node mesh NoC with 64-bit links can support a 16x16 switch with up to 948 Gbps in aggregate bandwidth, roughly matching the transceiver bandwidth on the latest FPGAs.

Simulators are growing in complexity to reflect these system components. However, many full-system simulators fail to utilize the underlying hardware resources such as multiple cores; consequently, simulation times have grown significantly. Long turnaround times limit the range and depth of design space exploration. Communication has emerged as a first class design consideration and has led to significant research into NoCs. NoC is yet another component of the architecture that must be faithfully modeled in simulation. Here, we focus on accelerating NoC simulation through the use of sampling techniques. We propose NoCLabs and NoCPoint, two sampling methodologies utilizing statistical sampling theory and traffic phase behavior, respectively. Experimental results show that NoCLabs and NoCPoint estimate NoC performance with an average error of 7% while achieving one order of magnitude speedup.

Therefore, optical NoCs must use a small number of wavelengths, avoid excessive insertion loss and reduce the number of microring resonators. We propose the Quartern Topology (QuT), a novel low-power all-optical NoC. We also propose a deterministic wavelength routing algorithm based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing that allows us to reduce the number of wavelengths and microring resonators in optical routers. The key advantages of QuT network are simplicity and lower power consumption. We compare QuT against three alternative all-optical NoCs: optical Spidergon, -router and Corona under different synthetic traffic patterns. QuT demonstrates good scalability with significantly lower power and competitive latency. Our optical topology reduces power by 23%, 86.3% and 52.7% compared with 128-node optical Spidergon, -router and Corona, respectively.

[ PDF ] SynFull is available for download here [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Modern and future many-core systems represent complex architectures. The communication fabrics of these large systems heavily influence their performance and power consumption. Current simulation methodologies for evaluating networks-on-chip (NoCs) are not keeping pace with the increased complexity of our systems; architects often want to explore many different design knobs quickly. Methodologies that capture workload trends with faster simulation times are highly beneficial at early stages of architectural exploration. We propose SynFull, a synthetic traffic generation methodology that captures both application and cache coherence behaviour to rapidly evaluate NoCs. SynFull allows designers to quickly indulge in detailed performance simulations without the cost of long-running full-system simulation. By capturing a full range of application and coherence behaviour, architects can avoid the over or underdesign of the network as may occur when using traditional synthetic traffic patterns such as uniform random. SynFull has errors as low as 0.3% and provides 50x speedup on average over full-system simulation.

As a result, memory represents a critical performance bottleneck for smartphones. This work1 introduces a set of emerging workloads for smartphones and characterizes the performance of several memory controller policies and address-mapping schemes for those workloads. The workloads include high-resolution video conferencing, computer vision algorithms such as upper-body detection and feature extraction, computational photography techniques such as high dynamic range imaging, and web browsing. This work also considers combinations of these workloads that represent possible use cases of future smartphones such as detecting and focusing on people or other objects in live video. While some of these workloads have been characterized before, this is the first work that studies address mapping and memory controller scheduling for these workloads. Experimental analysis demonstrates: (1) Most of the workloads are either memory throughput or latency bound straining a conventional smartphone main memory system. (2) The address mapping schemes that balance row locality with concurrency among different banks and ranks are best. (3) The FR-FCFS with write drain memory scheduler performs best, outperforming some more recently proposed schedulers targeted at multi-threaded workloads on general purpose processors. These results suggest that there is potential to improve memory performance and that existing schedulers developed for other platforms ought to be revisited and tuned to match the demands of such smartphone workloads.

[PDF] DistCL is available for download here [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : GPUs are used to speed up many scientific computations; however, to use several networked GPUs concurrently, the programmer must explicitly partition work and transmit data between devices. We propose DistCL, a novel framework that distributes the execution of OpenCL kernels across a GPU cluster. DistCL makes multiple distributed compute devices appear to be a single compute device. DistCL abstracts and manages many of the challenges associated with distributing a kernel across multiple devices including: (1) partitioning work into smaller parts, (2) scheduling these parts across the network, (3) partitioning memory so that each part of memory is written to by at most one device, and (4) tracking and transferring these parts of memory. Converting an OpenCL application to DistCL is straightforward and requires little programmer effort. This makes it a powerful and valuable tool for exploring the distributed execution of OpenCL kernels. We compare DistCL to SnuCL, which also facilitates the distribution of OpenCL kernels. We also give some insights: distributed tasks favor more compute bound problems and favour large contiguous memory accesses. DistCL achieves a maximum speedup of 29.1 and average speedups of 7.3 when distributing kernels among 32 peers over an Infiniband cluster.

April 2013. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Efficient broadcasting is essential for good performance on distributed or multiprocessor systems. Broadcasts are commonly used to implement message passing synchronization primitives, such as barriers, and also appear frequently in the set up stage of scientific applications.The Intel Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), an experimental processor, uses synchronous message passing to facilitate communication between its 48 cores. RCCE, the SCC's message passing library, implements broadcasting in a traditional way: sending n-1 unicast messages, where n is the number of cores participating in the broadcast. This implementation can hinder performance as the number of cores participating in the broadcast increases and if the data being sent to each core is large. Also in the RCCE implementation, the broadcasting core is blocked from doing any useful work until all cores receive the broadcast. This paper explores several broadcasting schemes that take advantage of the resources of the SCC and the RCCE library. For example, we explore a scheme that propagates a broadcast to multiple cores in parallel and a scheme that parallelizes off-chip memory accesses which would otherwise need to be done sequentially. Our best broadcast scheme achieves a 35x speedup over the RCCE implementation. We also demonstrate that our improved broadcasting substantially reduces the time spent on communication in some benchmarks. While the broadcast schemes presented in this paper are implemented specifically for the SCC, they provide insight into the more general problem of broadcast communication and could be adapted to other types of distributed and multiprocessor systems.

March 2013. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Die-Stacked DRAM caches offer the promise of improved performance and reduced energy by capturing a larger fraction of an applications working set than on-die SRAM caches. However, given that their latency is only 50% lower than that of main memory, DRAM caches considerably increase latency for misses. They also incur a significant energy overhead for remote lookups in snoop-based multi-socket systems. Ideally, it would be possible to detect in advance that a request will miss in the DRAM cache and thus selectively bypass it. This work proposes a dual grain filter which successfully predicts whether an access is a hit or a miss in most cases. Experimental results with commercial and scientific workloads show that a 158KB dual-grain filter can correctly predict data block residency for 85% of all accesses to a 256MB DRAM cache. As a result, off-die latency with our filter is nearly identical to that possible with an impractical, perfect filter.

The presence of thread sharing and the distribution of data across cache banks on the chip can result in longdistance communication. Long-distance communication incurs substantial latency that impacts performance; furthermore, this communication consumes significant dynamic power when packets are switched over many Network-on-Chip (NoC) links and routers. Thread migration can mitigate problems created by long distance communication. This article presents Moths, an efficient runtime algorithm that responds automatically to dynamic NoC traffic pat- terns, providing beneficial thread migration to decrease overall traffic volume and average packet latency. Moths reduces on-chip network latency by up to 28.4% (18.0% on average) and traffic volume by up to 24.9% (20.6% on average) across a variety of commercial and scientific benchmarks.

The key aspects of routing algorithm design include adaptivity, path selection strategy, VC allocation, isolation and hardware implementation cost; these design aspects are not independent. The key contribution of this work lies in the design of a novel selection strategy, Destination-Based Selection Strategy (DBSS) which targets interference that can arise in many-core systems running consolidation workloads. In the process of this design, we holistically consider all aspects to ensure an efficient design. Existing routing algorithms largely overlook issues associated with workload consolidation. Locally adaptive algorithms do not consider enough status information to avoid network congestion. Globally adaptive routing algorithms attack this issue by utilizing network status beyond neighboring nodes. However, they may suffer from interference, coupling the behavior of otherwise independent applications. To address these issues, DBSS leverages both local and non-local network status to provide more effective adaptivity. More importantly, by integrating the destination into the selection procedure, DBSS mitigates interference and offers dynamic isolation among applications. Results show that DBSS offers better performance than the best baseline selection strategy and improves the energy-delay product for medium and high injection rates; it is well suited for workload consolidation.

Gregory Steffan IEEE Transactions on Computers (Preprint [PDF] ) [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : The increased demand for on-chip communication bandwidth as a result of the multi-core trend has made packet-switched networks-on-chip (NoCs) a more compelling choice for the communication backbone in next-generation systems [1]. However, NoC designs have many power, area, and performance trade-offs in topology, buffer sizes, routing algorithms and flow control mechanismshence the study of new NoC designs can be very time-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a fast and flexible FPGA-based NoC simulation architecture. Rather than laying the NoC out in hardware on the FPGA like previous approaches [2], [3], our design virtualizes the NoC by mapping its components to a generic NoC simulation engine, composed of a fully-connected collection of fundamental components (e.g., routers and flit queues). This approach has two main advantages: (i) since it is virtualized it can simulate any NoC; and (ii) any NoC can be mapped to the engine without rebuilding it, which can take significant time for a large FPGA design. We demonstrate (i) that an implementation of DART on a Virtex-II Pro FPGA can achieve over 100x speedup over the cycle-based software simulator Booksim [4], while maintaining the same level of simulation accuracy, and (ii) that a more modern Virtex-6 FPGA can accommodate a 49-node DART implementation.

May 2012. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Networks-on-Chip (NoC) serve as efficient and scalable communication substrates for many-core architectures. Currently, the bandwidth provided in NoCs is overprovisioned for their typical usage case. In real-world multi-core applications, less than 5% of channels are utilized on average. Large bandwidth resources serve to keep network latency low during periods of peak communication demands. Increasing the average channel utilization through narrower channels could improve the efficiency of NoCs in terms of area and power; however, in current NoC architectures this degrades overall system performance. Based on thorough analysis of the dynamic behaviour of real workloads, we design a novel NoC architecture that adapts to changing application demands. Our architecture uses fine-grained bandwidth-adaptive bidirectional channels to improve channel utilization without negatively affecting network latency. Running PARSEC benchmarks on a cycle-accurate full-system simulator, we show that fine-grained bandwidth adaptivity can save up to 75% of channel resources while achieving 92% of overall system performance compared to the baseline network; no performance is sacrificed in our network design configured with 50% of the channel resources used in the baseline.

February 2012. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Across many architectures and parallel programming paradigms, collective communication plays a key role in performance and correctness. Hardware support is necessary to prevent important collective communication from becoming a system bottleneck. Support for multicast communication in Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) has achieved substantial throughput improvements and power savings. In this paper, we explore support for reduction or many-to-one communication operations. As a case study, we focus on acknowledgement messages (ACK) that must be collected in a directory protocol before a cache line may be upgraded to or installed in the modified state. This paper makes two primary contributions: an efficient framework to support the reduction of ACK packets and a novel Balanced, Adaptive Multicast (BAM) routing algorithm. The proposed message combination framework complements several multicast algorithms. By combining ACK packets during transmission, this framework not only reduces packet latency by 14.1% for low-to-medium network loads, but also improves the network saturation throughput by 9.6% with little overhead. The balanced buffer resource configuration of BAM improves the saturation throughput by an additional 13.8%. For the PARSEC benchmarks, our design offers an average speedup of 12.7% and a maximal speedup of 16.8%.

February 2012. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Routing algorithms for networks-on-chip (NoCs) typically only have a small number of virtual channels (VCs) at their disposal. Limited VCs pose several challenges to the design of fully adaptive routing algorithms. First, fully adaptive routing algorithms based on previous deadlock-avoidance theories require a conservative VC re-allocation scheme: a VC can only be re-allocated when it is empty, which limits performance. We propose a novel VC re-allocation scheme, whole packet forwarding (WPF), which allows a non-empty VC to be re-allocated. WPF leverages the observation that the majority of packets in NoCs are short. We prove that WPF does not induce deadlock if the routing algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC re-allocation. WPF is an important extension of previous deadlock-avoidance theories. Second, to efficiently utilize WPF in VC-limited networks, we design a novel fully adaptive routing algorithm which maintains packet adaptivity without significant hardware cost. Compared with conservative VC re-allocation, WPF achieves an average 88.9% saturation throughput improvement in synthetic traffic patterns and an average 21.3% and maximal 37.8% speedup for PARSEC applications with heavy network loads. Our design also offers higher performance than several partially adaptive and deterministic routing algorithms.

February 2012. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : This paper proposes three ILP-based static thermal-aware mapping algorithms for 3D Networks on Chip (NoC) to explore the thermal constraints and their effects on temperature and performance. Through complexity analysis, we show that the first algorithm, an optimal one, is not suitable for 3D NoC. Therefore, we develop two approximation algorithms and analyze their algorithmic complexities to show their proficiency. As the simulation results show, the mapping algorithms that employ direct thermal calculation to minimize the temperature reduce the peak temperature by up to 24% and 22%, for the benchmarks that have the highest communication rate and largest number of tasks, respectively. This comes at the price of a higher power-delay product. This exploration shows that considering power balancing early in the mapping algorithms does not affect the chip temperature. Moreover, it shows that considering the explicit performance constraint in the thermal mapping has no major effect on performance.

Existing locally and globally adaptive routing algorithms largely overlook issues associated with workload consolidation. The shortsightedness of locally adaptive routing algorithms limits performance due to poor network congestion avoidance. Globally adaptive routing algorithms attack this issue by introducing a congestion propagation network to obtain network status information beyond neighboring nodes. However, they may suffer from intra- and inter-application interference during output port selection for consolidated workloads, coupling the behavior of otherwise independent applications and negatively affecting performance. To address these two issues, we propose Destination-Based Adaptive Routing (DBAR). We design a novel low-cost congestion propagation network that leverages both local and non-local network information for more accurate congestion estimates. Thus, DBAR offers effective adaptivity for con- gestion beyond neighboring nodes. More importantly, by integrating the destination into the selection function, DBAR mitigates intra- and inter-application interference and offers dynamic isolation among regions. Experimental results show that DBAR can offer better performance than the best baseline algorithm for all measured configurations; it is well suited for workload consolidation. The wiring overhead of DBAR is low and DBAR provides improvement in the energy-delay product for medium and high injection rates.

Gregory Steffan NOCS '11 Proceedings of the Fifth ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip,2011 frames are not supported [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : The increased demand for on-chip communication bandwidth as a result of the multi-core trend has made networks on-chip (NoCs) a compelling choice for the communication backbone in next-generation systems [3]. However, NoC designs have many power, area, and performance trade-offs in topology, buffer sizes, routing algorithms and flow control mechanismshence the study of new NoC designs can be very time-intensive. To address this challenge we propose DART, a fast and flexible FPGA-based NoC simulation architecture. Rather than laying the NoC out in hardware on the FPGA like previous approaches [8, 6], our design virtualizes the NoC by mapping its components to a generic NoC simulation engine, composed of a fully-connected collection of fundamental components (e.g., routers and flit queues). This approach has two main advantages: (i) since FPGA implementation is decoupled it can simulate any NoC; and (ii) any NoC can be mapped to the engine without resynthesizing it, which can take time for a large FPGA design. We demonstrate that an implementation of DART can achieve over 100x speedup relative to a cycle-based software simulator, while maintaining the same level of simulation accuracy.

March 2010. [PDF] [SLIDES] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Scalable cache coherence is imperative as systems move into the many-core era with cores counts numbering in the hundreds. Directory protocols are often favored as more scalable in terms of bandwidth requirements than broadcast protocols; however, directories incur storage overheads that can become prohibitive with large systems. In this paper, we explore the impact that reducing directory overheads has on the network-on-chip and propose SigNet to mitigate these issues. SigNet utilizes signatures within the network fabric to filter out extraneous requests prior to reaching their destination. Overall, we demonstrate average reductions in interconnect activity of 21% and latency improvements of 20% over a coarse vector directory while utilizing as little as 25% of the area of a full- map directory.

Since existing research has greatly reduced router latency overheads and capitalized on available on-chip bandwidth, power constraints dominate interconnection network design. Recently research has pro- posed bufferless routers as a means to alleviate these constraints, but to date all designs exhibit poor operational frequency, throughput, or latency. In this paper, we propose an efficient bufferless router which lowers average packet latency by 17.6% and dynamic energy by 18.3% over existing bufferless on-chip network designs. In order to maintain the energy and area benefit of bufferless routers while delivering ultra-low latencies, our router utilizes an opportunistic processor-side buffering technique and an energy-efficient circuit-switched network for delivering negative acknowledg- ments for dropped packets.

Limited pin bandwidth prevents the integration of a large number of memory controllers on-chip. With many cores, and few memory controllers, where to locate the memory controllers in the on-chip interconnection fabric becomes an important and as yet unexplored question. In this paper we show how the location of the memory controllers can reduce contention (hot spots) in the on-chip fabric and lower the variance in reference latency. This in turn provides predictable performance for memory-intensive applications regardless of the processing core on which a thread is scheduled. We explore the design space of on-chip fabrics to find optimal memory controller placement relative to different topologies (i.e. mesh and torus), routing algorithms, and workloads.

(accepted 40/210). [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Scalable cache coherence solutions are imperative to drive the many-core revolution forward. To fully realize the massive computation power of these many-core architectures, the communication substrate must be carefully examined and stream- lined. There is tension between the need for an ordered interconnect to simplify coherence and the need for an unordered interconnect to provide scalable communication. In this work, we propose a coherence protocol, Virtual Tree Coherence (VTC), that relies on a virtually ordered interconnect. Our virtual ordering can be overlaid on any unordered interconnect to provide scalable, high-bandwidth communication. Specifically, VTC keeps track of sharers of a coarse-grained region, and multicasts requests to them through a virtual tree, employing properties of the virtual tree to enforce ordering amongst coherence requests. We compare VTC against a commonly used directory-based protocol and a greedy-order protocol extended onto an unordered interconnect. VTC outperforms both of these by averages of 25% and 11% in execution time respectively across a suite of scientific and commercial applications on 16 cores. For a 64-core system running server consolidation workloads, VTC outperforms directory and greedy protocols with average runtime improvements of 31% and 12%.

The presence of one-to-many (multicast) or one-to-all (broadcast) traffic can significantly degrade the performance of these designs, since they rely on multiple unicasts to provide one-to-many communication. This results in a burst of packets from a single source and is a very inefficient way of performing multicast and broadcast communication. This inefficiency is compounded by the proliferation of architectures and coherence protocols that require multicast and broadcast communication. In this paper, we characterize a wide array of on-chip communication scenarios that benefit from hardware multicast support. We propose Virtual Circuit Tree Multicasting (VCTM) and present a detailed multicast router design that improves network performance by up to 90% while reducing network activity (hence power) by up to 53%. Our VCTM router is flexible enough to improve interconnect performance for a broad spectrum of multicasting scenarios, and achieves these benefits with straightforward and inexpensive extensions to a state-of-the-art packet-switched router.

Lipasti In 2nd Annual IEEE Network on Chip Symposium , Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK, April 2008. [PDF] [PPT] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Our characterization of a suite of commercial and scientific workloads on a 16-core cache-coherent chip multiprocessor (CMP) shows that overall system performance is sensitive to on-chip communication latency, and can degrade by 20% or more due to long interconnect latencies. On the other hand, communication bandwidth demand is low. These results prompt us to explore circuit-switched networks. Circuit-switched networks can significantly lower the communication latency between processor cores, when compared to packet-switched networks, since once circuits are set up, communication latency approaches pure interconnect delay. However, if circuits are not frequently reused, the long setup time can hurt overall performance, as is demonstrated by the poor performance of traditional circuit-switched networks -- all applications saw a slowdown rather than a speedup with a traditional circuit-switched network. To combat this problem, we propose hybrid circuit switching (HCS), a network design which removes the circuit setup time overhead by intermingling packet-switched flits with circuit-switched flits. Additionally, we co-design a prediction-based coherence protocol that leverages the existence of circuits to optimize pair-wise sharing between cores. The protocol allows pair-wise sharers to communicate directly with each other via circuits and drives up circuit reuse. Circuit-switched coherence provides up to 23% savings in network latency which leads to an overall system performance improvement of up to 15%. In short, we show HCS delivering the latency benefits of circuit switching, while sustaining the throughput benefits of packet switching, in a design realizable with low area and power overhead.

[PDF] [PPT] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : While chip multiprocessors with ten or more cores will be feasible within a few years, the search for appliCations fully exploit their attributes continues. In the meantime, one sure-fire application for such machines will be to serve as consolidation platforms for sets of workloads that previously occupied multiple discrete systems. Such server consolidation scenarios will simplify system administration and lead to savings in power, cost, and physical infrastructure. This paper studies the behavior of server consolidation workloads, focusing particularly on sharing of caches across a variety of configurations. Noteworthy interactions emerge within a workload, and notably across workloads, when multiple server workloads are scheduled on the same chip. These workloads present an interesting design point and will help designers better evaluate trade-offs as we push forward into the many-core era.

[PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Modern processors attempt to overcome increasing memory latencies by anticipating future references and prefetching those blocks from memory. The behavior and possible negative side effects of prefetching schemes are fairly well understood for uniprocessor systems. However, in a multiprocessor system a prefetch can steal read and/or write permissions for shared blocks from other processors, leading to permission thrashing and overall performance degradation. In this paper, we present a taxonomy that classifies the effects of multiprocessor prefetches. We also present a characterization of the effects of four different hardware prefetching schemes--sequential prefetching, content-directed data prefetching, wrong path prefetching and exclusive prefetching--in a bus-based multiprocessor system. We show that accuracy and coverage are inadequate metrics for describing prefetching in a multiprocessor; rather, we also need to understand what fraction of prefetches interfere with remote processors. We present an upper bound on the performance of various prefetching algorithms if no harmful prefetches are issued, and suggest prefetch filtering schemes that can accomplish this goal.

Synchronization is a prime example of a potential bottleneck, but is a necessary evil when writing parallel programs; we must enforce correct access to shared data. Even the most expert programmers may find synchronization to be a significant overhead in their application. Techniques to mitigate synchronization overhead include speculative lock elision, faster hardware barriers, and load balancing via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and thread migration to asymmetric cores. A key insight is that the timing of synchronization events, impacted not only by the progress of the current thread but also others, is fundamental to an application's performance. To enable a better understanding of multithreaded applications, we propose analytical model centered around the timing and ordering of synchronization events. Our model allows research across the stack to evaluate the performance of applications on future, nonexistent systems and architectures. Compared to real hardware, our model estimates performance with an average of 7.2% error across thirteen benchmarks and can generate performance characteristics per thread in less than a minute on average for very large (native) inputs.

As systems scale to dozens or hundreds of cores, we simply cannot afford the power consumption and latency of random communication that spans the entire chip. Existing hierarchical Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) support communication locality only for a fixed cluster of nodes; providing a fixed hierarchy is too restrictive in terms of parallelism and data placement. Therefore, we propose a new, more flexible class of hierarchical NoCs: Elastic Hierarchical NoCs. Elastic Hierarchical NoCs dynamically adjust the number and size of clusters during runtime according to the system's communication demands. The interconnect can adapt to changes in communication locality across different application phases, between applications and in the presence of server consolidation. Our design improves overall system performance by up to 46% and 13% on average over a conventional 2D mesh and by up to 16% and 6% on average over an existing hierarchical NoC implementation. Power consumption is reduced by 45% and 7% respectively on average.

[PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX] Abstract : This work exploits the tolerance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduced precision numerical representations and specifically, their ability to use different representations per layer while maintaining accuracy. This flexibility provides an additional opportunity to improve performance and energy compared to conventional DNN implementations that use a single, uniform representation for all layers throughout the network. This work exploits this property by proposing PROTEUS, a layered extension over existing DNN implementations that converts between the numerical representation used by the DNN execution engines and a shorter, layer specific fixed-point representation when reading and writing data values to memory be it on-chip buffers or off-chip memory. When used with a modified layout of data in memory, PROTEUS can use a simple, low-cost and low energy conversion unit. On five popular DNNs, PROTEUS can reduce data traffic among layers by 41% on average and up to 44% compared to a baseline that uses 16-bit fixed-point representation, while maintaining accuracy within 1% even when compared to a single precision floating-point implementation. When incorporated into a state-of-the-art accelerator PROTEUS improves energy by 14% While maintaining the same performance. When incorporated on a graphics processor PROTEUS improves performance by 1%, energy by 4% and reduces off-chip DRAM accesses by 46%.

[PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX] Abstract : Modern prefetchers can generally be divided into two categories, spatial and temporal, based on the type of correlations they attempt to exploit. Although these two types have different advantages, and perform well on different application sets, a design that utilizes both types of information will be able to achieve greater prefetch accuracy. We address the lack of temporal information in the state-of-the-art Spatial Memory Streaming (SMS) prefetcher by proposing Tempo, a novel banked implementation of SMS that further classifies cache accesses within the same physical page based on the repetitive miss latency, or tempo, present in the local access stream. Evaluated on the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite, Tempo reduces useless prefetches by 17.6%, and achieves 1.45% and 2.57% increase in IPC on high and low bandwidth memory configurations over a purely spatial SMS design.

Accelerating Network-on-Chip Simulation via Sampling Wenbo Dai and Natalie Enright Jerger International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (poster) , 2014. [PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX] Abstract : Architectural complexity continues to grow as we consider the large design space of multiple cores, cache architectures, networks-on-chip and memory controllers for emerging architectures. Simulators are growing in complexity to reflect each of these system components. However, many full-system simulators fail to take advantage of the underlying hardware resources such as multiple cores; as a result, simulation times have grown significantly in recent years. Long turnaround times limit the range and depth of design space exploration that is tractable. Communication has emerged as a first class design consideration and has lead to significant research into networks-on-chip (NoC). The NoC is yet another component of the architecture that must be faithfully modeled in simulation. Given its importance, we focus on accelerating simulation of the NoC through the use of sampling techniques; sampling can provide both accurate results and fast evaluation. We propose NoCLabs and NoCPoint, two sampling methodologies utilizing statistical sampling theory and traffic phase behavior, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed NoCLabs and NoCPoint estimate NoC performance with an average error of 5\% while achieving one order of magnitude speedup on average.

[PDF] [ Abstract ] [ BibTeX ] Abstract : Approximate computing recognizes that many applications can tolerate inexactness. These applications, which range from multimedia processing to machine learning, operate on inherently noisy and imprecise data. As a result, we can trade-off some loss in output value integrity for improved processor performance and energy-efficiency. In this paper, we introduce load value approximation. In modern processors, upon a load miss in the private cache, the data must be retrieved from main memory or from the higher-level caches. These data accesses are costly both in terms of latency and energy. We implement load value approximators, which are hardware structures that learn value patterns and generate approximations of the data. The processor can then use these approximate data values to continue executing without incurring the high cost of accessing memory. We show that load value approximators can achieve high coverage while maintaining very low error in the application's output. By exploiting the approximate nature of applications, we can draw closer to the ideal memory access latency.

While power models are available for CPUs and GPUs, only simple models are available for heterogeneous processors. We present a micro-benchmark-based modeling technique that can be used for chip multiprocessor (CMPs) and accelerated processing units (APUs). We use our approach to model power on an Intel Xeon CPU and an AMD Fusion heterogeneous processor. The resulting error rate for the Xeon's model is below 3% and is only 7% for the Fusion. We also present a method to reduce the number of benchmarks required to create these models. Instead of running micro-benchmarks for every combination of factors (e.g. different operations or memory access patterns), we cluster similar micro-benchmarks to avoid unnecessary simulations. We show that it is possible to eliminate as many as 93% of the compute micro-benchmarks, while still producing power models having less than 10% error rate.
