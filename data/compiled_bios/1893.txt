Christos Kozyrakis Professor, EE & CS, Stanford University Home Research Teaching Publications Software Students Fun Contact Christos Kozyrakis is an Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University. He leads the multi-scale architecture & systems team (MAST), a research group that investigates hardware architectures, runtime management environments, system software, and programming models for systems ranging from cellphones to warehouse-scale datacenters. His current research focuses on resource efficient cloud computing, energy efficient compute and memory systems for emerging workloads, and scalable operating systems. Christos joined Stanford in 2002 after receiving a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley. His alma mater is the University of Crete in Greece. He is a fellow of the ACM and the IEEE. Christos' first name in full is "Christoforos". Updates I am teaching C349D Cloud Computing in Fall'17. My view on the Role of Hardware in Datacenter Efficiency.
