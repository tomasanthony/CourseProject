 Jiepu Jiang Virginia Tech My research helps people better search, understand, and use information from text corpora. I apply a combination of information retrieval, data/text mining, and HCI methods to study search engines, conversational agents (chatbots), exploratory text analytics, and other related techniques. Dr. Jiepu Jiang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech (started in August 2018). He directs the Human AI Technology (HAT) lab and is affiliated with the Discovery Analytics Center (DAC) and the Digital Library Research Lab (DLRL). He has been regularly publishing and serving in top conferences in information retrieval and data mining such as SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, and CIKM. His research has received the best student paper award in CHIIR 2017 (the ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction & Retrieval). He holds B.S. and M.S. degrees from Wuhan University, a Ph.D. in Library & Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and is finishing up another Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
