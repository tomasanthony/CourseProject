["Professor of Electrical Engineering-SystemsEducationDoctoral Degree, Electrical Engineering, University of Southern CaliforniaMaster's Degree, Electrical Engineering, University of Southern CaliforniaBachelor's Degree, Physics, California Institute of Technology BiographyB. Keith Jenkins received the B.S. degree with honors in Applied Physics from the California Institute of Technology (1977), and the M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1984) degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California.  He is currently a Professor of Electrical Engineering at USC.  After receiving the NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award (1988-1993) for work applying photonics to computing systems, his research activities expanded to also include miniaturization of 3-D photonic computing systems, optical and computer holography, neural networks, object and pattern recognition, biologically inspired vision algorithms, and biomedical infrared imaging. Research SummaryExperimental and theoretical research in the areas of:  parallel computing systems incorporating electronics, photonics, and optics; optical interconnections, including computer generated holographic elements, diffractive optical elements, and volume holographic elements; neural networks for information processing, including optical and photonic implementations, adaptive volume holographic systems, neural learning algorithms and neural-network models for optical implementation; 3-D photonic multichip modules, including multilayer hardware components, neurobiologically inspired vision algorithms for parallel implementation, and techniques for mapping algorithms to hardware; other topics, including modeling of volume holographic recording processes in photopolymer materials, parallel computation models for photonic computing systems, and advanced multidimensional displays; neurobiologically inspired models for early vision algorithms and for learning sparse representations; pattern recognition and biologically inspired techniques for object recognition; infrared techniques for probing brain function, with possible application to brain-computer interfaces; optical metamaterials.Awards2014 Hughes Aircraft Co.
