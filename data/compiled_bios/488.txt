I founded the UChicago SUPERgroup, an interdisciplinary research collective with dozens of members. Our research spans computer security, privacy, and human-computer interaction (HCI). We are especially interested in using data-driven methods to help users make better security and privacy decisions, as well as to make complex computer systems more usable for non-technical users. Our work has been supported by four NSF grants, as well as grants from Mozilla Research and the Data Transparency Lab. My dissertation focused on supporting users\' password-security decisions with data. I have also worked extensively on supporting users\' online privacy and on the Internet of Things (IoT). I received my PhD in 2016 from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Lorrie Cranor. I have been fortunate to receive three best paper awards (CHI 2017, USENIX Security 2016, & UbiComp 2014), the 2018 SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award, the 2018 IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice (jointly with other members of the CMU passwords group), the 2016 John Karat Usable Privacy and Security Student Research Award, an NDSEG fellowship, a Fulbright scholarship, and two honorable mentions for best paper (CHI 2016 & CHI 2012). I value transferring research to practice, such as through the Bank Privacy website and Password Guessability Service. I have strong interests in teaching and K-12 outreach, particularly for broadening participation in CS. I earned my AB in computer science from Harvard University and worked for three years at Rutgers University on outreach and diversity programs. My first name is pronounced "blaze," and my full name is pronounced "blazer." I prefer to be called Blase rather than Professor Ur or Dr. Ur, both of which sound ridiculous. (Note, just Blase, not Professor Blase or Dr. Blase). I am also a musician and photographer, and previously a theatre designer. I ride my bicycle (almost) everywhere, collect records, travel, and drink too much coffee. I\'m from somewhere in the swamps of New Jersey.
