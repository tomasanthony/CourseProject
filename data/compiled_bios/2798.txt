Cheriton	School of Computer Science, University of	Waterloo	E-mail: christopher.batty@uwaterloo.ca	Office: 3605 Davis Centre (DC3605)	Brief Bio Google	Scholar DBLP Twitter	Join my lab, the Computational Motion Group:	I am always looking for highly motivated and hard-working Master's and PhD students to work with, as well as current Waterloo Undergraduates. Follow the link to learn more.	Recent news:	I was thrilled to receive a Faculty of Science Honoured Alumni award for Achievement in Computer Science from my undergraduate institute, the University of Manitoba. (Jan 31, 2019)	Jade Marcoux-Ouellet has completed her MMath thesis. Congratulations! (Dec 19, 2018)	I'll be a program co-chair for the 2019 Symposium on Computer Animation in Los Angeles. Submit your work! (Sept 16, 2018)	Our lab's work was highlighted in a recent article in Motherboard and on Waterloo's home page.	I've joined the ACM Transactions on Graphics board as an Associate Editor. Looking forward to reading some great submissions. (June 15, 2018)	Our paper on wet fabric simulation, led by Columbia PhD student Raymond Fei, will appear at SIGGRAPH 2018! (March 28, 2018)	Animations:	Research:	I pursue research in Physics-Based	Animation, which combines	computer graphics and computational physics	 see our Perspective	piece in Science for an overview, or this Motherboard article	for a more fun take. My students and I comprise the	Computational Motion Group at Waterloo, and	we are affiliated with the Computer Graphics Lab	and the Scientific	Computation Group. Our research often focuses on	the simulation of liquids and gases, but I'm	broadly interested in physical simulation as a	tool for generating, controlling, and	predicting motion of all kinds. I strive to design	algorithms that are supported by sound physical,	mathematical, and geometric principles, while being	amenable to efficient and robust practical	implementation.	I have developed methods for...	interactions between dynamic objects (e.g., hair, cloth, elastic bodies, rigid bodies) and	fluids	animating and representing thin splashes and	droplets	viscous and non-Newtonian liquids which display exotic behaviours like coiling and bouncing	surface tension-driven phenomena, including small-scale liquids, bubbles, and	foams	solving PDEs in a spatially adaptive fashion, especially on tetrahedra and quad/octrees	evolving multimaterial flows and geometries	Applications in the animation and visual effects industries motivate	much of my work. My students and I collaborate with	Side Effects	Software (makers of Houdini), and I have previously	worked with Weta Digital,	Exocortex	Technologies, and the (now-defunct VFX division of) Frantic	Films. Aspects of my research have been incorporated into	major fluid animation software packages by Side Effects Software	(Houdini), Blender (Flip Fluids), AutoDesk	(Maya/Bifrost), Exocortex Technologies (MaelstromFX),	and Navi	(EFFEX), and as a result have contributed to dozens	of movies from major studios.	While at Frantic Films, I personally worked on	Superman	Returns, Scooby Doo 2:	Monsters Unleashed, and Wes Craven's Cursed.	I created and continue to manage the Physics-Based	Animation blog, which catalogues papers, people, and	software in this area.	I have also collected links to a few pieces of advice for students that you may (or may not) find	useful.	Publications:	A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Fabric Interactions	Y. Fei, C.

Part One PPTX	PDF	Part Two PPTX	PDF	Code and Data:	Below you'll find miscellaneous sample code and data from some	of my projects; in other cases you can find the code for a	given publication on its associated project page (linked	above). Buyer beware, of course, but I'd love to hear from you	if you do put any of it to use!	Los	Topos	The code for our multimaterial mesh-based surface	tracking library, as described in our appropriately-named	SIGGRAPH 2014 paper "Multimaterial Mesh-Based Surface	Tracking". It generalizes and extends the original	El Topo framework of Tyson Brochu and Robert Bridson to	the case of multiple materials, and includes an improved	merging strategy that is effective even in the standard	two-material case.	Non-manifold Simplicial Complex Mesh	Library	vv This is my own implementation of a non-manifold	simplicial complex-based mesh library, including arbitrary	data associated to vertices, edges, triangles and	tetrahedra. It's essentially my spin on the data structure	outlined in "Building Your Own DEC at Home" with an API	similar to "Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of the	Surface_mesh Data Structure". The main goal is to allow	non-manifold geometry and mixed dimensional components	(tets, tris, segments), while being relatively simple to	manipulate. It's a work in progress and not currently being	maintained.	[GitHub	link]	3D Liquid Simulator code	A minimal grid-based 3D liquid simulator and OpenGL	viewer, using semi-Lagrangian advection, volumetric	particles for the liquid, ghost fluid free surface	conditions, and support for irregular solid boundaries	using the variational/finite-volume approach from our	SIG'07 paper. The only dependencies should be the GLUT	library, so it's hopefully easy to set up and experiment	with. Here's a sample clip. Update: I also added	another version with our	variational viscosity technique implemented in	3D.	[Inviscid	code, on GitHub]	[With viscosity, on GitHub]	2D Variational Viscosity code	Sample code illustrating how to use our	variational viscosity discretization to support	rotation and buckling and variable viscosity within the	liquid solver below. (The link for the comparable 3D code	is above.)	[Github link]	2D Variational Pressure Projection with Rigid Body Coupling	code	Sample codes illustrating how to use our	variational pressure projection to support static	irregular geometry within a very simple 2D "stable fluids"	style fluid solver.	Air - Single phase fluid	solver with static obstacles.	Liquid - Free	surface liquid solver with static obstacles. This code	combines our irregular solid boundary discretization with	the 2nd order free surface pressure boundary condition of	Enright et al. 2003.	NEW Liquid with a Rigid Body - I've recently added two-way rigid body coupling, and	posted this to Github.	SDFGen: Signed Distance Field Generator for triangle	meshes	A simple command-line utility to construct a signed	distance field from a triangle mesh, which is often useful	for physics-based animation, such as in processing	collisions for rigid objects.	[Github	link]	Watertight	Stanford bunny	I ran into some problems due to the holes in the	bunny, and since I couldn't find a watertight version	online, I made one myself (for non-commercial use, of	course). It's also in OBJ format, rather than the original	PLY. Thanks to the Stanford 3D	Scanning Repository for the original	model.	2D	Polygon Moment of Inertia Tensor Code	I couldn't find any convenient code for computing 2D	inertia tensors from the vertices and edges of a simple	polygon, so I adapted/specialized Michael Kallay's	excellent 3D code from the Journal of Graphics Tools	article	Computing the Moment of Inertia of a Solid Defined by a	Triangle Mesh. The article mentions how to handle 2D	bodies, but the accompanying	code supports only 3D objects. My code provides the	corresponding 2D implementation, while retaining the speed,	brevity, and clarity of the original.	Higher	Order Data Extrapolation in the Normal Direction	A sample Matlab implementation of quadratic	extrapolation in the normal direction of a function from a	region defined by a given signed distance function into a	surrounding undefined region, essentially following Ng et	al. 2009, Min & Gibou 2007, and Aslam 2003. This can be	useful for extrapolating known velocities from a fluid	region into a solid region, such as in the Ghost Fluid	Method, for example. [Note: I haven't actually rigourously	verified the target order of convergence is	achieved.]	Background:	For two years following my PhD (2011-2013)	I was a postdoc in the Computer Science Department at the	Columbia University	in New York City, supported by an NSERC Banting Fellowship.	My advisor was Dr. Eitan	Grinspun.	My PhD is from the Computer Science	Department at the University of	British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. I worked under the	supervision of Dr.	Robert Bridson, beginning in 2005 and defending in	2010. During my degree I also did some work for Ottawa-based	Exocortex	Technologies, Weta Digital in New Zealand,	and Intel's Applications	Research Lab in Santa Clara, California.	Prior to my academic career, I spent	2004-2005 working at former Winnipeg-based visual effects	studio, Frantic Films, where I was a Software Engineer in	Research and Development. My job was to develop physics	tools for artists based on recent academic research,	including smoke, water, and rigid and deformable bodies.	These tools were used on various films, including	Superman Returns, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters	Unleashed, and Cursed. (Much of the software	division is now at Thinkbox	Software.)	I'm a graduate of the Computer Science	Honours Co-op program at the University of Manitoba,	having completed my Bachelor of Computer Science degree in	the fall of 2003. In addition to Frantic Films, I also	interned at	OTI (original developers of Eclipse, now a subset of	IBM) and Protegra,	Inc.	Miscellaneous:	Some old stray thoughts	about the problem of reconstructing tri-meshes from signed	distances.
