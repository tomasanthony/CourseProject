Abraham Matta received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1995. He works on the design of network protocols and architectures based on a range of computer science principles (such as inter-process communication, decomposition, and recursion), mathematical techniques (such as probabilistic analysis, queuing theory, optimization, and control theory), and performance evaluation tools (such as simulation and emulation). Application domains include the Internet, wireless, mobile, sensor, and disruption-tolerant networks, cloud and distributed systems. He has published over 100 peer-reviewed technical papers. He received the National Science Foundation CAREER award (1997). He won a patent (2011) and two best-paper awards (2008 and 2010) on his work on wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. He has served as chair or co-chair of many technical program committees, such as the IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications (2012), IEEE Computer Communications Workshop (2011), and International Conference on Network Protocols (2005). He has served on many organizing committees, including as general chair of the 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (2006). He is a senior member of the ACM and IEEE.
