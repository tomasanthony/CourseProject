Ding Yuan Sandford Fleming 2002E 10 King's College Road Toronto, ON M5S 3G4 Canada yuan at eecg dot toronto dot edu About me I am an associate professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and (by courtesy) Department of Computer Science , University of Toronto. I joined Univ. of Toronto in January 2013, after I received my Ph.D from the Computer Science Department of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of a great advisor, Yuanyuan Zhou . From 2009 to 2012 I was also a visiting student in the awesome System and Networking group of University of California, San Diego . I received a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Beihang University . (New) I have a great student, Xu Zhao , on the job market this year! My research interest is systems software, with a focus on developing practical solutions to improve the availability and performance of large software systems. I am looking for self motivated students to work with me. If you are interested, please submit your application here . News 2018/1: Xu Zhao won Facebook Fellowship ! Congrats Xu! [ Publication ] 2017/7: We have two papers accepted by SOSP 2017 ! Congratulations to all my students! [ Publication ] 2017/3: Our JVM warm-up paper appears in Usenix ;login: [ Impact ] 2016/10: Our JVM warm-up paper is covered by The Next Platform . [ Impact ] 2016/8: Caitie McCaffrey gave an amazing presentation on our Simple Testing paper in Papers We Love@QCon New York . [ Publication ] 2016/7: We have two papers accepted by OSDI'16 ! Congratulations to Xu, Kirk, and Jack for their failure diagnosis paper, David, Adrian, Hailong, and Xin for their paper on JVM warm-up overhead! [ Job ] 2015/4: Yongle will intern in Microsoft Research Redmond this summer. [ Publication ] 2015/2: Our OSDI paper on failure analysis appears in usenix ;login: [ Impact ] 2014/10: HBase developers will use aspirator , a simple bug finding tool described in our OSDI paper , as their compile-time checker! [ Impact ] 2014/10: Our OSDI paper on distributed system failures prompted many online discussions: Hacker News [1] , [2] , Discussions from HBase developers, which prompted a series of reactions to address the problems we mentioned in the paper. Twitter discussions: see this , this , and this (if you're looking for a screenshot that summarizes our paper, see this or this ). Blog: the morning paper (also it is considered as a highlight of 2016 ), It Will Never Work In Theory , Another word for it , Metadata , Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve Your Tests , Postmortem lessons , Some discussions on Google+ . And quite a few emails sent to us from developers... [ Fun ] 2014/10: Yongle and I each gave a talk in OSDI; Yongle gave a cool demo of lprof in his talk, making his advisor look bad as I did not do one in mine :) [ Publication ] 2014/7: We have two papers accepted by OSDI'14 ! [ Job ] 2014/4: Xu will go to the Bay area for a summer internship in Twitter.

I served as captain of the Beihang's CSE basketball team and co-captain of the UIUC CS faculty & grad-student basketball team in the intramural games. I also ran some marathon and half-marathons (see a recent photo here ). When I have more time, I also play accordion.
