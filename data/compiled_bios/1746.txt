He is also an External Member of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP) , Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitt, Munich. He received his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005, and studied previously at Trinity College Dublin and Technical University of Darmstadt . Research interests My research interests fall into the areas of history and philosophy of mathematics and science, epistemology, and cognitive science. In particular, I am interested in the developments in the 19th and early 20th century that led to the emergence of modern mathematics and logic, and in systematic investigations regarding axiomatics, the use of notation, analogical reasoning, concept formation, and theory development. I am also involved in editorial projects of the works of Pasch, Hilbert, Bernays, and Carnap.
