I am a professor of Computer Science at Brandeis University with affiliations in Psychology and the Volen National Center for Complex Systems. My research is interdisciplinary with a strong computational basis. Early in my career my primary focus was in artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling. Currently my lab is doing research on educational technology and collaborative learning. There is also a project on skill acquisition and training in the use of application software. The research framework of my lab uses a mix of methods from different fields. I am a long time member of the Cognitive Science community, which is my core community. I am on the editorial board of the International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. The common theoretical themes of my research are planning and activity, communication, and collaboration.
