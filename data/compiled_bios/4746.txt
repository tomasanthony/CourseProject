Where do we go from here? We will discuss a few directions where computer vision can be either further pushed to deal with data scarcity and data noise, or synergistically integrated with other disciplines such as NLP and data mining, to continue to advance the frontiers of artificial intelligence. Harvesting the Healing Power of AI and Big Data With the recent rapid advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science, a promising domain is healthcare and wellness management. In this talk, we discuss two directions: first, leveraging electronic medical data including unstructured forms and videos to build robust algorithms for disease diagnosis and medical training, and second and more interestingly, utilizing social media data to detect and alter user unhealthy behaviors such as drinking, smoking, drug-use, and eating disorder. It is also intriguing how these two directions can be combined synergistically, and further to implement effective and innovative intervention. When Computer Vision meets E-Commerce Two of the top 10 largest companies by market cap i n the world, namely Amazon and Alibaba, are e-commerce companies that are enjoying huge success. At the same time, computer vision and artificial intelligence are making strides in both technologies and applications. What power can be unleashed when computer vision meets e-commerce. We will present a few recent advances in user profiling, behavior analytics, product recommendation, as well as deep sales data mining. Video and Language Video has become ubiquitous on the Internet, TV, as well as personal devices. Recognition of video content has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision for decades, where previous research predominantly focused on recognizing videos using a predefined yet limited vocabulary. Thanks to the recent development of deep learning techniques, researchers in multiple communities are now striving to bridge videos with natural language in order to move beyond classification to interpretation, which should be regarded as the ultimate goal of video understanding. We will present recent advances in exploring the synergy of video understanding and language processing techniques, including video-language alignment, video captioning, and video emotion analysis. Computational Inference of Emotion in Images With the recent successes in using deep learning techniques to solve computer vision problems, the performances of the state of the art algorithms in many areas, especially object recognition, have been dramatically improved. Researchers are now inspired to address yet more challenging problems, such as associating pictures with aesthetics, and have also reported progress. One remaining final frontier in extracting meaning from images is related to the recognition of emotions that images arouse in humans. The key challenges are the loose and highly abstract nature of semantics associated with emotions. We will discuss how to effectively employ a data-intensive approach to emotion recognition in images, as well as multimedia that include both image and text information. You Are What You Post: Personal Analytics from Big Social Media Data From the abundance of personal records, public data, and user-generated social multimedia contents, rich information can be inferred regarding user profile, user interests, user sentiment, user behaviors, user mobility, user lifestyles, as well as user physical and mental health. We will present a few recent advances in this important arena. 2016 Presidential Election: Donald Trump De-mystified With social media being increasingly utilized to boost political campaigns, Donald Trump looms large in the 2016 US Presidential Election. With the ability to track the Twitter followers of the major candidates in the running, we conduct a series of in-depth, fine-grained, data-driven analyses, including 1) Will Sanders Supporters Jump Ship for Trump? Fine-grained Analysis of Twitter Followers?, 2) Pricing the Woman Card: Gender Politics between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and 3) Voting with Feet: Who are Leaving Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? These studies represent a new paradigm for studying political campaigns and provide valuable insight at unprecedented scales and in real-time. Big Data Better Life We live in the age of big data. The biggest big data is big visual data, which includes images and other associated information. The biggest challenge is to develop effective computational methods for making sense of such massive visual data. Unlike text which is clean, segmented, compact, one dimensional and indexable, visual content is noisy, unsegmented, high entropy and multidimensional. In this talk, we present a few recent advances towards the ultimate goal of using big data, in particular large-scale and rich multi-modality data, to achieve robust intelligence in order to understand and improve life in terms of healthcare, well-being, politics, business, infotainment, and so on. Vision with A Billion Eyes A recent trend in computer vision is driven by images and video generated by heterogeneous and multi-perspective visual sensing networks. We present a few examples of research along this line. First, we will present an interesting framework for event recognition. With GPS information, we obtain satellite images corresponding to picture locations and investigate their novel use to recognize the picture-taking environment. We then combine this inference with classical vision-based event detection methods and demonstrate the synergistic fusion of the two approaches. Second, to determine the viewing direction for geotagged photos, we utilize both Google StreetView and Google Earth satellite images. Third, we explore using phone-captured images for localization as it contains more context information than the embedded sensory GPS coordinates. We then build applications to enable people to enjoy ubiquitous location-based services (LBS) using their phones. Fourth, we leverage crowd-sourced photos to remove unwanted bystanders from tourist photos taken at popular attractions and measure air pollution in major cities in China. Furthermore, given a new source of visual data from public webcams deployed in urban environments, we will present some ongoing work on crowd analytics using such data. Social Multimedia as Sensors Social multimedia can be exploited as a powerful new way of sensing social behaviors and activities from user-generated social multimedia contents, including building user profiles from a user's personal photo collection, inferring user personality traits from social media language usage, producing popular and diverse tourism routes from crowd-sourced geo-tagged photos, extracting user sentiment from both textual and visual information in social media, monitoring risky behaviors such as teenage drinking and drug abuse, and forecasting election outcome based on image sharing activities and user demographics extracted using computer vision techniques. Finally, we will share thoughts on current challenges and future directions.
