Brief biography I am Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the Department of Computer Science at UCL, and a member of UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC, jointly supported by the Department of Computer Science and the Division of Psychology and Language Sciences). I was Director of UCLIC 2004-2011. In 2013, I was recognised as an academic role model in the School of Life and Medical Sciences , a testament to UCL's support for interdisciplinary working. I am also a parent and a grandparent. In 2015, I was appointed as the first Director of the UCL Institute of Digital Health , and was a Suffrage Science award holder (2016-2018). My first degree is in Mathematics, from Cambridge University, and my PhD is in Artificial Intelligence and Education, from the Open University. I started my career in industry as a software engineer, followed by a period managing the Computer Assisted Teaching Unit at QMUL. I gradually developed a focus on the use and usability of computer systems. In 1991, I joined the Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge as a research scientist, working on the AMODEUS project. I moved to Middlesex University, initially as a lecturer, and subsequently as Professor and Director of Research in Computing Science. I moved to UCL as a Senior Lecturer in 2002 and became a professor (again) in 2005. My focus is now on technology for health and wellbeing. I have been technical programme chair for IHM-HCI 2001, HCI 2006, DSVIS 2006, NordiCHI2010 and ICHI 2016. I chaired AISB (1997-1999), and was a member of the EPSRC Information and Communications Technologies Strategic Advisory Team (2004-2008). I was Vice Chair of IFIP Working Group 2.7/13.4 (2010-2013). I am a Fellow of the BCS and a member of the UK Computing Research Committee (UKCRC) . I Chaired UKCRC (2016-18) and am serving on the REF 2021 sub-panel on Computer Science and Informatics.
