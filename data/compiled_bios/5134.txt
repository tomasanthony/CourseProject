I'm also an Adjunct Faculty in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at Duke University . I work in the area of machine learning and Bayesian statistics. My research is primarily on probabilistic modeling of massive and complex data. I focus on designing probabilistic latent variable models and efficient optimization/inference algorithms that can learn compact and interpretable latent structures and feature representations from such data, and leveraging these to better understand/summarize the data and make better predictions/decisions.
