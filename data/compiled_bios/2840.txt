This is an	"Advanced Topics" course, offered at both the undergraduate and	graduate level.	Undergraduates (CS489): Students will work on a course	project, of their own choosing. Students may work	individually or in groups. Grades: 50% assignments, 50%	project. NO EXAM.	Graduates (CS698): Graduate students have	the same assignments, but will be expected to undertake a	individual, research oriented project, to write up the result as	a research paper, and to present to the class. Grades: 35%	assignments, 15% presentation, 50% report.	Undergraduate Information Session, Monday October 16, 2017, at	3:30-5:00 pm, in DC 1302. (PDF)	(Video).
