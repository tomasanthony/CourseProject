Most of my current research is in the area of granular computing: new software stack layers that allow the execution of large numbers of very small tasks (as short as a few microseconds) in a datacenter. Current work includes projects developing new techniques for thread management, network communication, and logging. I am also Faculty Director of the Stanford Platform Lab, a research group that includes several faculty and projects in the areas of distributed systems, large-scale systems, and networking. Biography I received a BS in Physics from Yale University in 1975 and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980. From 19801994 I was a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My research projects included design tools for integrated circuits such as the Magic layout editor and the Crystal timing analyzer, the Sprite network operating system, log-structured file systems, the Tcl scripting language, and the Tk toolkit. In 1994 I left Berkeley to fulfill a long-standing desire to build commercial software. From 19941998 I was a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories. In 1998 I founded Scriptics Corporation to commercialize Tcl development tools, where I was CEO until 2000. In 2002 I founded Electric Cloud. I was at Electric Cloud until 2007, and I led the development of a parallel build system (ElectricAccelerator) and a Web-based server for managing distributed processes such as nightly builds and automated tests (ElectricCommander). In 2008 I returned to academia in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford. Selected Publications H. Qin, Q. Li, J. Speiser, P. Kraft, and J.
