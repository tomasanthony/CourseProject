 Lenhart K. Schubert Professor Computer Science Department Rochester, NY 14627-0226 Email: lastname AT cs DOT rochester DOT edu Fax: (585) 273-4556 Ph.D. (1970) University of Toronto. Assistant Professor (73-77), Associate Professor (77-84), Professor (84-88); University of Alberta. Professor (88-present), University of Rochester. I am also a member of the Center for Language Sciences (CLS) . My research interests center around language, dialogue agents, knowledge representation, inference and planning. These interests are tied together by the general goal of developing agents with common sense, self-awarenes, self-motivation, and the ability to converse and acquire knowledge through language. Some specific topics my collaborators and I have worked on include very expressive, language-like logics to capture the content of ordinary language and commonsense reasoning as directly as possible; the most recent is called Episodic Logic ; schemas (subsuming scripts, frames, and plans) for guiding understanding and behavior (including dialogue); semantics of events/situations, tense/aspect, reference, affixes, mass terms, generic sentences, belief, questions, vagueness; efficient, specialized inference techniques for taxonomies, part-structure, temporal relations, and other classes of relations that pervade commonsense knowledge and are handled effortlessly by people; rule-based probabilistic inference using algebraic probabilities; high-fidelity semantic parsing, allowing for the full expressivity of natural language; natural-logic-like inference based on unscoped logical forms; development of implementations of scalable inference engines for Episodic Logic integrating general deductive, probabilistic, and specialized inference mechanisms; Deriving general world knowledge from texts and taxonomies , as an attack on the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck" in AI; the current system is called KNEXT (KNowledge EXtraction from Text). reasoning about plans and actions, in support of both language understanding (e.g., conversation planning and inferring the goals and plans of story characters) and domain reasoning (e.g., formulating plans of action in a transportation domain); automatically discovering invariants in planning domains -- see the DISCOPLAN system; solving the Frame Problem using "explanation closure".
