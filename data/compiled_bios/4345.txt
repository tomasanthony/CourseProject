I am a faculty member in Computer Science and Engineering in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering of Arizona State University. The department offers graduate degrees in Computer Science as well as Computer Engineering. Therefore, if you are interested in ASU, I encourage you to apply to the degree major that best suits your background and interests.  If you are a student at ASU and are interested in my research work, I encourage you to take my courses (Computer Architecture and/or Advanced Computer Architecture) and perform well in class. In general, I am happy to talk to students who show a sincere interest in understanding my research before expressing a generic interest in working with me.  If you are considering to apply forPhD programs, here is the document  Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science  written by Mor Harchol-Balter. Reading her document would be very instructive. I am also happy to discuss about graduate school opportunities with students who consider this path.
