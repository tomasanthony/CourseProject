My interests extend from there	into nonphotorealistic rendering. I also dabble in human-computer	interaction, computational geometry and programming languages.	Pages devoted to specific research projects	I wrote a short book that offers an introduction to	tiling theory suitable for computer scientists.	Complete list of publications	A separate page about my doctoral dissertation,	Computer Graphics and Geometric Ornamental Design	Teaching	Fall 2017:	CS 135 -- Designing Functional Programs	CS 898 -- Machine Learning in Computer Graphics	Previous terms	Other Activities	I'm one of the organizers of the	Bridges Conference,	an annual event about art and mathematics.	Miscellaneous	My academic genealogy.	Presentation tips, compiled from	a seminar by Edward Tufte.	A page about the correct uses of "it's"	and "its".	A simple introduction to the halting problem.	Pot Pourri (stinky pot)	Watch a video of my alter ego, Damien Underwood, giving an	overview of	Alternative Computing Paradigms to unsuspecting prospective	graduate students at the University of Washington.	Everyone talks about getting their heads examined, but not many	people are willing to do something about it. Get a	good, close look at my head.	Relieve that parched throat with a refreshing	glass of water.	Apparently, I have a wife. I'm given to believe that her	name is Nath.	Family photos	Other photos	Last updated:
