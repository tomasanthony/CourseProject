I study models for the digital description and production of sound. I am investigating minimal network infrastructure to support public key cryptography/signature, based on the "nym" idea of self-signed key records. In the past, I designed and implemented the first lazy functional programming language, defined precisely by the rules of equational logic. I have also investigated computational semantics for nonclassical logics, leading to a new understanding of constructive logic as a logic of proofs that can be communicated accurately in spite of some discrepancies in the language.
