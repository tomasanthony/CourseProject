 Steve Oney Steve Oney Assistant Professor Michigan School of Information 4381 North Quad / soney@umich.edu I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. My research focuses on enabling and encouraging more people to write and customize computer programs by creating new programming tools and exploring usability issues in programming environments. I completed my Ph.D in Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute where I was advised by Brad Myers and Joel Brandt. I also attended MIT (CS & math S.B. in 2007, CS M.Eng in 2008).
