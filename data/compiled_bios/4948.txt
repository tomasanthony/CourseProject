This covers broad theoretical questions as well as practical implementation of various solutions. In my research group, we often prove theorems but we also build and test our theoretical findings when possible ( graduate applicants, please refer to this link! ). In particular, the work can be broadly broken into the following areas: 1. Information Acquisition-Utilization and Controlled Sensing, 2. Stochastic Control and Optimization of Networks, and 3. Communicating with Application-specific Constraints. Learn more News Our work on " Active Learning with Logged Data " has been accepted for publication at ICML 2019. Congratulations, Songbai!
