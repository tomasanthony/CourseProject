 Kartik Nayak kartik@cs.duke.edu I will join Duke University as an Assistant Professor starting Fall 2019. Presently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at VMware Research hosted by Dahlia Malkhi and Ittai Abraham. I graduated from the University Of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Katz and Professor Elaine Shi . I am a recipient of the 2016 Google Ph.D. fellowship in Security. I work in the area of security, applied cryptography, distributed computing and blockchains. I am looking for Ph.D. students. If you are interested in working in security, applied cryptography and/or blockchains, please drop me an email and apply here .
