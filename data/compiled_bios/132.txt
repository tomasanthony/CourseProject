 NISHEETH K. VISHNOI NISHEETH K. VISHNOI RESEARCH My research spans several areas of theoretical computer science: from approximability of NP-hard problems, to combinatorial, convex and non-convex optimization, to tackling algorithmic questions involving dynamical systems, stochastic processes and polynomials. I am also broadly interested in understanding and addressing some of the key questions that arise in nature and society from the viewpoint of theoretical computer science. Here, my current focus is on natural algorithms, emergence of intelligence, and questions at the interface of AI, Ethics, and Society.
