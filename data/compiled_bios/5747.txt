I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from New York University (working with Ralph Grishman and Kyunghyun Cho ), and my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Hanoi University of Science and Technology . I am also a postdoc in the University of Montr&#233al , working with Yoshua Bengio and people in the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms . RESEARCH My research explores mechanisms to understand human languages for computers so that computers can perform cognitive language-related tasks for us. Among others, I am especially interested in distilling structured information and mining useful knowledge from the massive human-written text of various domains. Toward this end, our lab employs and designs effective learning algorithms for information extraction and text mining in natural language processing and data mining. We are currently focusing on deep learning algorithms to solve such problems. We are among the first groups that develop deep learning models and demonstrate their effectiveness for information extraction. We are also targeting other language-related problems with deep learning, including reading comprehension, machine translation, natural language generation, and chatbots. NEWS I am currently recruiting one or two graduate students for Fall 2019 to work on interesting projects of natural language processing and deep learning. Interested candidates can email me for more information. The application procedure for graduate students in the Department of Computer and Information Science can be found here . I am also willing to supervise students at UO who would like to do research on natural language processing, deep learning and the related topics. Please email me if you are interested in this possibility.
