 Shlizerman's Research Group on Data-driven Dynamical Systems Home Research Publications Group Teaching About Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics and Electrical & Computer Engineering | Washington Research Foundation Professor E-mail: shlizee uw.edu Office(Amath): Lewis Hall 230D Office(ECE): ECE 446 Phone: 206 543 6658 Fax: 206 685 1440 Research in our group combines dynamical systems theory with data analysis to produce realistic data-driven dynamical models. Investigations are at the interface of development of generic computational approaches and modeling actual biological and physical systems. With the data-driven methodology Eli Shlizerman (PI) and members of the group are working on modeling neurobiological networks underlying insects' sensory systems and neural dynamics of organisms .

Favorite Tweets by @shlizee Open positions! Students interested in research at the intersection of neuronal networks, data-science and neuromorphic computing are invited to join the group. Prof. Shlizerman will be admitting 1-2 well-qualified PhD students. Applications are due to the Department of Electrical Engineering or the Department of Applied Mathematics. Excited to join? Please contact Prof. Shlizerman for further information and indicate your interest on the application. Exceptional postdoctoral candidates are welcome to contact as well. Funding: Our research is supported by the National Science Foundation DMS/NIGMS Initiative at the Interface of Bio. and Math. Sciences, Air-Force Office for Scientific Research and Washington Research Foundation Fund for Innovation in Data-Intensive Discovery.
