 Qiang Liu Home Group Publications Talks/Slides Workshops Qiang Liu Qiang Liu Assistant Professor Computer Science University of Texas at Austin lqiang(at)cs.utexas.edu Office: GDC 4.806 ("Qiang" sounds like "Chee-ah-ng", and "Liu" as "l-yo") Research My research area is machine learning and statistics, with interests spreading over the pipeline of data collection (e.g., by crowdsourcing), learning, inference, decision making, and various applications using probabilistic modeling. Examples of topics of interest: probabilistic graphical models; variational and Monte Carlo inference; deep learning; deep reinforcement learning; distributed learning; big data problems; kernel and nonparametric methods; applications: crowdsourcing, vision, bioinformatics, etc. I am an action editor of Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) . News Check my recent / upcoming talks and slides . Three papers accepted by NIPS 2018 I am an area chair of NIPS 2018 and ICLR 2019 I am visiting the deep learning foundations group in Microsoft research Redmond this summer (2017).
