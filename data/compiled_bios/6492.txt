 Sorin Lerner Projects Students Teaching Papers PL@UCSD Teaching now Sorin Lerner Professor and Vice-Chair, CSE @ UCSD Office: EBU3B 3116 email: lerner@cs.ucsd.edu I develop Programming Language techniques and apply them to various domains, including program verification, security/privacy, and HCI. I am always looking for great grad students and post-docs to join our group. Current Work VeriDrone : Verification of Cyber-physical Systems Polymorphic Blocks : Block-based UI for proofs/types Proof Games : Crowdsourcing proofs via gamification Attending GHC : UCSD presence at Grace Hopper CSE's Efforts on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Previous Work While the projects below are mostly wrapped up, they give you a flavor for the kind of research I'm interested in. Collider : Correct opts from high-level specifications Radar : Concurrent analyses from sequential ones Quail : Deep Typechecking & Refactoring Arcum : Crosscutting design idioms, made modular Code Spells: Game that teaches coding Reflex : Verification of reactive systems in Coq Quark : Practical web browser verified in Coq Javascript : Analysis for Javascript security TV-HLS : Verification for High-Level Synthesis Parsimony : Construct parsers by example Eddie : Synthesize interactive diagrams Students Alex Sanchez-Stern (Ph.
