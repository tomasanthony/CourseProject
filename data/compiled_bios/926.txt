 Jimmy Ba Assistant Professor (Starting 2018) Department of Computer Science Machine Learning Group University of Toronto Vector Institute Supervision Teaching Publications Curriculum vit My long-term research goal is to address a computational question: How can we build general problem-solving machines with human-like efficiency and adaptability? In particular, my research interests focus on the development of efficient learning algorithms for deep neural networks. I am also broadly interested in reinforcement learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence. For future students : I am starting the Assistant Professor position at the Department of Computer Science in mid 2018. Please apply through the department admission . Short bio: I'm completing my PhD under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton . Both my master (2014) and undergrad degrees (2011) are from the University of Toronto under Brendan Frey and Ruslan Salakhutdinov . I was a recipient of Facebook Graduate Fellowship 2016 in machine learning. -- Google scholar page contact me: jba at cs.toronto.edu Current postdocs Bradly C.
