David Crosbie focuses on Blockchain, Cryptoassets, and Cryptocurrencies. He co-teaches a cross-discipline course on this topic and is currently creating two online Coursera courses - one for a general audience, and the second as part of the online masters in computer science (MCIT) focused on blockchain and applied cryptography. He is actively involved in nurturing student involvement in this space. He has helped grow the Penn Blockchain club from zero into the second largest blockchain club in the world with over 650 active students - a major annual conference, student-run classes, weekly guest speakers, and an excellent flow of startups, patents, and students hired into this industry. His academic research interests are focused on blockchain scaling, security, and fine grain privacy. David has a MA in Engineering Science from Oxford University and an MBA from INSEAD in France.
