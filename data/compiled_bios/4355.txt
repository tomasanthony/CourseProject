( https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/the-cloud-and-mobile-revolution-whats-next ) General Information Giuseppe Ateniese is the David and GG Farber Endowed Chair in Computer Science and department chair at Stevens Institute of Technology. He was with Sapienza-University of Rome (Italy) and Assistant/Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University (USA), and one of the founders of the JHU Information Security Institute. He was a researcher at IBM Zurich Research lab (Switzerland) and scientist at the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (USA). He also briefly worked as visiting professor at Microsoft in Redmond (USA). He received the NSF CAREER Award for his research in privacy and security, and the Google Faculty Research Award, the IBM Faculty Award, and the IEEECISTC Technical Recognition Award for his research on cloud security. He has contributed to areas such as proxy re-cryptography, anonymous communication, two-party computation, secure storage, and provable data possession. He has served in the program committees of international security conferences (such as ACM CCS, IEEE Oakland, and NDSS) and as panelist of the US National Science Foundation. He is currently working on cloud security and machine learning applied to security and intelligence issues for which he received an IBM SUR Award. He is also investigating new security applications for decentralized computing based on the blockchain/bitcoin technology. Joined Stevens in January 2016. Investiture ceremony on December 5, 2016.
