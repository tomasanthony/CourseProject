Research Areas of Interest "If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?" Albert Einstein (1879-1955) Prof. Ammari's primary research interests lay in the area of wireless sensor and mobile ad hoc networks. In particular, he is interested in energy-efficient data dissemination, coverage, connectivity, fault-tolerance, and security in wireless sensor networks. Specifically, his research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of energy-efficient, optimized, localized, fault-tolerant, and secure data dissemination and topology control protocols for promoting the longevity of wireless sensor networks. Another facet of his research work is concerned with the design of secure, adaptive, and fault-tolerant architectures for connecting wireless sensor and mobile ad hoc networks to the global IP Internet with a goal to provide the user with seamless ways to access the sensed data. In his research, he uses fundamental concepts and models from computational geometry, such as Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation; graph theory, such as connectivity and conditional connectivity; and physics and chemistry, such as percolation theory. Prof. Ammari's research areas of interest can be summarized as follows: Wireless sensor networks Applied cryptography Cybersecurity Physical security Computational geometry Student Research Prof. Ammari leads the Wireless Sensor and Mobile Ad-hoc Network Applied Cryptography Engineering (WiSeMAN-ACE) Research Lab whose objective is to conduct fundamental research in wireless sensor and mobile ad-hoc networking. He will consider highly motivated graduate and undergraduate students to actively participate in WiSeMAN-ACE Research Lab, where both theory and practice are connected. The focus of WiSeMAN-ACE Research Lab is on k -coverage, k -barrier coverage, connectivity, fault tolerance, geographic forwarding, deployment, cryptography, and security in wireless sensor networks. Specifically, WiSeMAN-ACE Research Lab emphasizes the design, analysis, and implementation of energy-efficient and secure topology control and data dissemination protocols for wireless sensor networks with a goal to optimize the very scarce energy resources of the sensors and extend the network lifetime. He believes that real experiments are very critical for research in wireless sensor networks. Therefore, WiSeMAN-ACE Research Lab will have the necessary equipments in terms of motes, such as MICAZ motes, as well as all other required interfaces, such as MIB 510 programming boards and sensor boards, to build up a sensor testbed, which will help students to conduct real experiments. Any sound protocol designed to be used by the sensor nodes should be first implemented to assess its practicality. Conducting real experiments will help students discover other types of problems and work hard to solve them. If you are interested to work with Prof. Ammari on your Master's thesis or project, senior capstone project, or independent study project that is related to his research topics, or to gain a research experience as undergraduate, and you feel that WiSeMAN-ACE Research Lab is a perfect place for you, please send him an email at hammari@cis.fordham.edu or drop by his office, which is located in Room 336 on the third floor of the John Mulcahy Hall .
