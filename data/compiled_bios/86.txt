The translation service in WeChat provides tens of millions of unique translations for users of the messenger app [ arXiv:1807.02340 ]. An approach (in collaboration with Microsoft Research Asia ) for translating natural language sentences to regular expressions has been proposed to make the translation more robust and effective in real-world settings [ EMNLP'18 , NL4SE'18 ]. Microservice Dependability TrainTicket (in collaboration with Fudan University ), a medium-size open source benchmark microservice system, has been released to be leveraged by both industry and academia to carry out research around microservice systems. The system includes 70+ microservices (41 business microservices), including 30,000+ lines of code, along with 22 fault cases reproduced from real industry cases. Upon this system, our new techniques on debugging microservice systems have been proposed [ ICSE'18 Poster , ASE'18 Short ]. A blog post by Fudan CodeWidsom (in Chinese).

In 2018, ICSE 2012 Paper on StackMine selected as the single representative paper in year 2012, and among the 20 representative papers (one paper a year) selected from over 5,000 research papers published by Microsoft Research Asia during its 20 years. In 2015, ICSE 2012 Paper on StackMine rated among the most practically relevant software engineering research (ranked the second place) of the last five years in an industrial relevance study published in ESEC/FSE 2015 . CarStream (in collaboration with Beihang U. and CAR Inc. ), a scalable, high-performance Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) system, has been deployed to offer chauffeured car services for over 30,000 vehicles at CAR Inc. [ VLDB'17 Industry , TII'17 , PerCom'18 ] . Mobile anlytics solutions (in collaboration with Peking U , U. Michigan , and Wandoujia Lab , a top Android App Store in China) have characterized diverse app-usage patterns by learning the behavioral data from over 17 million users, and optimizing development and release planning. [ IMC'15 , ICSE'16 , TSE'17 ]. Software Security WHYPER (in collaboration with NC State U. ), the first system of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mobile app security, has opened up the new field of text analytics for mobile security. Google has awarded a Google Faculty Research Award to support the follow-up work of WHYPER, which inspired and influenced internal related efforts inside Google . [ USENIX Security'13 ] ACPT (Access Control Policy Tool) (in collaboration with NIST ) is available as a beta release . ACPT was covered by IEEE Intelligent System magazine , Industry Cortex , ScienceDaily , Center for Internet Security (CIS) , etc. From its initial release in 2011 till May 2017, ACPT attracted 460 acquisitions from major industrial, academic, and government organizations. and this number is continuously increasing. Example early adopters of ACPT include NSA, MITRE, DISA, NOAA, SAIC, DNI, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Fermi Lab, BAE system, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, SMI, VA government, John Hopkins University. InfoBeyond Technology LLC has developed Security Policy Tool as a full deployable ACPT version with advanced functions and has officially released Security Policy Tool since July 1, 2017. On October 14, 2017, InfoBeyond Technology was awarded the Innovative Security Solution Award for their demonstration of Security Policy Tool at the 2017 IEEE Big Data and SDN/NFV Summit . See the Mentionable Milestones of Security Policy Tool for our ACPT research's impact. [ TSP'08 , POLICY'10 Demo ] Educational Software Engineering Code Hunt (in collaboration with Microsoft Research Redmond ), an educational gaming platform, has already had close to 6 million (5,981,893) users (including registered users playing on www.codehunt.com, anonymous users and accounts that access api.codehunt.com directly via the documented REST APIs) since its release in Spring 2014 till July 24 2017, for about three years.
