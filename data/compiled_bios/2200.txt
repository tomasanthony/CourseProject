 Rezaul A. Chowdhury Associate Professor Department of Computer Science 239 New Computer Science Building Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY 11794-2424 USA Email: rezaul AT cs DOT stonybrook DOT edu I lead the Theoretical and Experimental Algorithmics (TEA) Group where we concentrate on both algorithm design and algorithm engineering. I have a joint appointment with the Institute for Advanced Computational Sciences (IACS) . I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Sciences , UT Austin, working with Professor Vijaya Ramachandran , and defending this: "Cache-efficient Algorithms and Data Structures: Theory and Experimental Evaluation" . Prior to joining SBU, I was in Boston working with Professor Sandor Vajda 's Structural Bioinformatics Group at Boston University , and Professor Charles Leiserson 's SuperTech Research Group at MIT . Before moving to Boston, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Computational Visualization Center (CVC), Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences (ICES), University of Texas at Austin . I worked with Professor Chandrajit Bajaj . (Links to my other pages that still exist: BU , MIT ) I am a BS in Computer Science & Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology . My undergraduate supervisor was Professor Mohammad Kaykobad to whom I am infinitely indebted. Research Interests Design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for combinatorial problems , especially, - Algorithms for massive datasets: external-memory , cache-oblivious , streaming , parallel , etc. - Algorithms for multicore computing . - Graph algorithms: static and dynamic , exact and approximate , etc. Computational Biology and Bioinformatics - structure-based drug design , protein-protein docking , protein flexibility , energetics , sequence alignment , etc. Computer-aided Algorithm Design.
