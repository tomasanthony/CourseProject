Mert Sabuncu Assistant Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 300 607/2559720 Assistant Professor Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering msabuncu@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Mert R. Sabuncu joined Cornell University in July 2017 as Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a secondary appointment in the School of Biomedical Engineering. He will be transitioning from a faculty position at the A.A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital). Dr. Sabuncu received a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University, where his dissertation work focused on entropy-based image registration. He then moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to do a post-doc at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). His post-doc work dealt with developing algorithms to analyze large-scale biomedical image data.. Research Interests Biomedical image analysis, with application focus in neurology/neuroscience Applied machine learning in bio-medicine Probabilistic modeling of biological (e.g., genetic) data Image processing, computer vision. Biotechnology Artificial Intelligence Computer Aided Diagnosis Image Analysis Signal and Image Processing Statistics and Machine Learning Bioengineering Biomedical Engineering Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation Computational Science and Engineering Neuroscience Systems and Synthetic Biology Systems and Networking Research Group Members.
