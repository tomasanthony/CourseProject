Finding DGFs for anisotropic media have been very challenging due to its complexity. My research has been to obtain the DGFs for several different types of anisotropic media  including (i) uniaxially anisotropic medium, (ii) biaxially anisotropic medium, (iii) electrically gyrotropic (gyroelectric) medium, and (iv) magnetically gyrotropic (gyromagnetic) medium. Wave propagation and scattering involving complex media: The DGFs that we obtained above are used to solve a variety of theoretical and practical problems involving complex (anisotropic) media. We have investigated and solved the problems of wave propagation, reflection &amp; transmission, radiation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in the presence of such anisotropic media as well as bianisotropic media. Problems of antennas and microstrip circuits have also been treated.
