The Flynn Research Group is a part of the Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience Department at the University of Michigan. RESEARCH Our main interest is in analog and mixed-signal circuits, analog-to-digital conversion, and other interface circuits. These include high-speed serial transceivers, RF transceivers and sensors. Our main focus is on circuits that transfer information between the analog and digital domains. Publications See more about our journal and conference papers. People The Flynn Group is made up of both graduate and undergraduate students with a range of interests within circuit design. Recent News CONGRATULATIONS TO 2018 GRADUATES FROM THE FLYNN GROUP!! Congratulations toSunmin Jang, Ph.D.,Daniel Weyer, Ph.D., and Adam Mendrela, Ph.D.! click here to read more... Congratulations to Daniel Weyer, PhD student in the Flynn group, on having his paper accepted to ISSCC 2018! Daniels paper on an FMCW chirp synthesizer PLL was accepted to the highly prestigious IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) held in San Francisco, CA in February of 2018. In his paper, Daniel describes his work on a digital fractional-N 38GHz PLL and introduces a noise-shaping TDC based on a bandpass delta-sigma modulator. Daniel was spending the fall of 2017 in the bay area where he was doing an internship when he learned that his paper had been accepted. The day when I learned the news was the most memorable day of my internship. My phone went off several times that morning. This is a big deal.
