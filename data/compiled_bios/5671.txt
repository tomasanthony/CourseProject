 Mark Allen Weiss Mark Allen Weiss is an Eminent Scholar Chaired Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education in the College of Engineering and Computing at Florida International University in Miami Florida. He also serves as Interim Founding Director of the School of Universal Computing, Construction, and Engineering EDucation (SUCCEED) having previously served for nine years as Associate Director of the School of Computing and Information Sciences. He received his Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from The Cooper Union in 1983, and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 1987, working under Bob Sedgewick . He has been at FIU since 1987, and was promoted to Professor in 1996. His interests include data structures, algorithms, and education, and he is most well-known for his highly-acclaimed Data Structures textbooks, which have been used at hundreds of universities worldwide. From 1997-2004 he served as a member of the Advanced Placement Computer Science Development Committee , chairing the committee from 2000-2004. Dr. Weiss is an IEEE Fellow, AAAS Fellow, and ACM Distinguished Educator. He is the recipient of the 2015 SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education, 2017 IEEE Computer Society Taylor Booth Education Award, and 2018 IEEE Education Society William Sayle Achievement in Education Award.

I've included the most recent errata, source code, and a link to the publisher's home page. Solutions Manual and/or Instructors Resource Manual are available from Addison-Wesley for the Data Structures books to course instructors only. Contact your sales rep , or call Addison-Wesley. This is the only way to get solutions. I do not have any copies of solutions manuals. As a matter of policy, I cannot provide answers to questions in the text, because it is impossible for me to determine if I would be doing somebody's homework. Thus, I must decline to answer the growing number of emails that request such assistance. 2013 2012 2010 2007 2007 2006 2004 2002 2000 1999 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1995 1994 1993 1993 1992 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (Third Edition) Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ (Fourth Edition) Published by Addison-Wesley, 2012 ISBN: 0-132-57627-9 / 9780132576277 CS-7 Text Errata (last update 11/06/17) Source code .
