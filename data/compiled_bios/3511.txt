David Attwood: Contact Information attwood@berkeley.edu : Research Areas Applied Physics, particularly involving x-ray optics, the generation of coherent radiation at EUV and x-ray wavelengths, and applications to nanoscale imaging. . Research Centers SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) . . Biography David Attwood received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from New York University in 1972. He has been a Professor in Residence at UC Berkeley since 1989. He was co-founder of the Applied Science and Technology Ph.D. program. He has been faculty advisor for the undergraduate Engineering Physics program for 25 years. His research interests center on the use of short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, x-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation in the 0.1-30 nm range. Topics of particular interest include coherance at x-ray wavelengths, element specific nanoscale imaging, and EUV lithography. He and his students are active in the use of novel Fourier optics, image contrast techniques, and the development and use of coherent sources at these short wavelengths. At the contiguous Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, he was founding Director of the Center for X-Ray Optics (CXRO), and was first (1985-1988) Scientific Director of the Advanced Light Source (ALS). He is a Fellow Member of the American Physical Society and the Optical Society of America, and is an International Fellow of the Japanese Society of Applied Physics (2016). He is author of X-Rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation: Principles and Applications, (Cambridge University Press, 2017). His lectures have been broadcast live over the Internet and electronically archived. His most recent courses are X-rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation Fall 2016, 2017, 2019.
