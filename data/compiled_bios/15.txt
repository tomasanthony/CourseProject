Kevin C.C. Chang is a Professor in Computer Science , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , where he leads the FORWARD Data Lab for search, integration, and mining of data. He received a BS from National Taiwan University and PhD from Stanford University , in Electrical Engineering. His research addresses large scale information access, for search, mining, and integration across structured and unstructured big data, with current focuses on "entity-centric" Web search/mining and social media analytics. He received two Best Paper Selections in VLDB 2000 and 2013, an NSF CAREER Award in 2002, an NCSA Faculty Fellow Award in 2003, IBM Faculty Awards in 2004 and 2005, Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellow Award in 2008, and the Incomplete List of Excellent Teachers at University of Illinois in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2011. He is passionate to bring research results to the real world and, with his students, co-founded Cazoodle , a startup from the University of Illinois, for deepening vertical "data-aware" search over the web.

Our BigSocial: Towards Big Social Data Platform for Entity-Centric and User-Aware Analytics project is awarded NSF Award 1619302 , $500,000, III: Small: Social Discovery of Users and Content in Social Media Through Similarity-Based and Graph-Based Inference of Attributes and Queries . PI: Kevin C.C. Chang . News . Research. I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, o ur research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management , entity-centric Web search and mining , social media analytics, and social network mining . As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.
