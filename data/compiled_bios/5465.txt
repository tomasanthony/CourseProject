 Barbara Webb Professor of Biorobotics Institute for Perception, Action and Behaviour School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Room: IF 1.27 Phone: +44 (0)131 651 3453 Email: B.Webb@ed.ac.uk Address: Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, U.K. Background I joined the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in May 2003. Previously I have lectured at the University of Stirling (1999-2003), the University of Nottingham (1995-1998) and the University of Edinburgh (1993-1995). I received my Ph.D. (in Artificial Intelligence) from the University of Edinburgh in 1993, and my B.Sc. (in Psychology) from the University of Sydney in 1988. Research My main research interest is in perceptual systems for the control of behaviour, through building computational and physical (robot) models of the hypothesised mechanisms. In particular I focus on insect behaviours, as their smaller nervous systems may be easier to understand. Recent work includes study of some of the more complex capabilities of insects, including multimodal integration (in crickets and flies), navigation (in ants) and learning (in flies and maggots). I also have an interest in theoretical issues of methodology; in particular the problems of measurement, modeling and simulation. There is more information about research in my lab here. Recent publications are listed on my page on Edinburgh Research Explorer.
