Adam Finkelstein Professor Computer Science Department Princeton University af@cs.princeton.edu af[at]cs[dot][this school][dot]edu Before I started drinking 8 cups of coffee a day, my hair was limp and lacked body. I work on computer graphics in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University . My research interests revolve around creating tools that help professional and novice artists express themselves in the digital medium, including photo and video manipulation and stylized rendering for animation. I have been an active contributor and volunteer at the ACM SIGGRAPH conference, and chaired the SIGGRAPH 2014 Technical Papers program. With others at Princeton, I founded and organize Art of Science Exhibition. I received a doctorate from the University of Washington in 1996. From 1987 to 1990, I was a software engineer at Tibco (formerly Teknekron Software Systems) in Palo Alto; I wrote software for people who trade stock. I was an undergraduate student (class of 87) at Swarthmore College , where I studied (occasionally) physics and computer science. I have received a number of awards including the NSF CAREER Award and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM . teaching research contact images personal
