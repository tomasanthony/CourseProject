Robert G. Meyer: Contact Information 505 Cory Hall tel: 510-642-8026 rmeyer@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Integrated Circuits (INC) . . . Biography Professor Meyer received the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree (First Class Honors) in 1963 from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and in 1965 he was awarded the degree of Master of Engineering Science (Honors) for his thesis entitled 'Evaluation of noise parameters of bipolar and field-effect transistors.' In 1968 he was awarded the Ph.D. degree from the University of Melbourne for his thesis entitled 'Signal and noise performance of transistor mixers.' He was awarded the J.J Thomson Premium for 1968 from the Institution of Electrical Engineers for research on noise in transistor mixers. From January to September, 1968, Professor Meyer was employed as an Assistant Lecturer in Electrical Engineering at the University of Melbourne. Since September, 1968, he has been employed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, where he is now National Semiconductor Distinguished Professor Emeritus. His current research interests are integrated-circuit design and device fabrication, with particular emphasis on nonlinear phenomena and noise performance. He is co-author of the book Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits, (Wiley, 1977, 1984, 1993, 2001), editor of the book Integrated Circuit Operational Amplifiers, (IEEE Press, 1978), and co-editor of the book Integrated Circuits for Wireless Communications, (IEEE Press, 1999). He has acted as a consultant on electronic circuit design for numerous companies in the electronics industry. He is a past President of the Solid-State Circuits Council of the IEEE. In 1973, 1976 and 1987 he was a Guest Editor of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits and from 1976 to 1982 he was an Associate Editor of the Journal. He is a former Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems. In 1975 he was a Visiting Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, and in 1996 and 2003, he was a Visiting Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department of Columbia University, New York. In 2003, he received the IEEE Leon K. Kirchmayer Graduate Teaching Award for distinguished graduate teaching. In 2014, he received the IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award for pioneering contributions to the design and modeling of analog and radio-frequency circuits. He holds eight U.S. patents, and he is a Fellow of the IEEE. . .
