I obtained my Ph.D in computer science from the Computer Science Department at Boston University in summer 2007, and was an Assitant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Florida State University from Aug 2007 to Aug 2011. A more detailed version about myself is here [ ]. I am a member of the Data Group at Utah . Data Driven Science Dong Xie is one of the 10 Microsoft Research PhD Fellows for Class of 2018-2019! See the news release for more details. We are excited to open source the first release of the XDB (approXimate DB) system . The first release contains the PosgreSQL (9.4.2) version that has fully integrated online aggregation (with the support for SPJ and Group By queries, including joins over multiple tables) into the kernel of PostgreSQL. We have released both the kernel-version and the stand-alone version of Simba system , which is a Spark/Spark-SQL extention to in-memory cluster-based large scale spatial data analytical engine Our study on using deep learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis over geo-tagged tweets for analyzing and predicting this year's Presidential election is covered by Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News . See our project website at http://www.estorm.org The joint work on using social media data to build healthy/unhealthy geo-indicators with quynh nguyen from department of health promotion and education and others is featured on time.com . the project hashtaghealth is open-sourced on github and an interactive map layer is also available. Our STORM project is highlighted in NSF's news release on ``Data Driven Science'': College of Engineering News Report. , NSF News Release. Research Interests Database systems and large-scale data management, systems, and analytics. Security issues in data management and systems. Mining and machine learning driven methods for system performance tuning, monitoring, and data analytics. I am grateful to NSF for supporting my past and ongoing research on: database security issues (projet completed) ranking and aggregate query processing in probabilistic data (projet completed) distributed data management system with potentially fuzzy and uncertain data new architectures and systems for big data workloads building trustworthy cloud platforms summarizing big data big data system analytics systems over encrypted databases, link1 , link2 I am also grateful to Google Research, HP Labs, and Florida Department of Revenue for supporting my research on managing and processing various large complex data they have. My PhD thesis is about query and data security issues in the data outsourcing model .
