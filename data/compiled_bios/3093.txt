 Joshua Brody Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Swarthmore College 500 College Ave Swarthmore, PA 19081 phone: 610-690-6866 email: brody at cs.swarthmore.edu Home CV Teaching Research Schedule anonymous feedback I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Swarthmore College . I received a Ph.D. in computer science in September 2010 from Dartmouth College , where I was fortunate to be advised by Amit Chakrabarti . Between Dartmouth and Swarthmore, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University and Aarhus University . Prior to graduate school, I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Burkina Faso , where I taught high school mathematics and introductory computer skills. My main research area is theoretical computer science. I am particularly interested in communication complexity, and in how communication lower bounds give you lower bounds in areas such as streaming algorithms, property testing, and data structures.
