Please use other emails to contact me. Research Interests I work on systems and networking. I lead the NetX Lab. Welcome to visit us! Our research is/was supported by funding from Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, Huawei, Microsoft Research Asia, Azure, Amazon Web Services, etc. Current Projects ML/DA systems : machine learning and data analytics are important, but system and deployment support of ML/DA is often the bottleneck to real-world use Resource scheduling , schedule jobs/tasks/executors with maximum efficiency Distributed training , faster and easier distributed training for large-scale ML Data center networking : what would the future data center network look like?
