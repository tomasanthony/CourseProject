 Sang-Woo Jun Assistant Professor at University of California, Irvine Some News 2018-06-06 " Thanks for the memories ", The Next Platform's article on my research Assistant professor at the Computer Science Department Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences University of California, Irvine Contact: swjun _AT_ ics.uci.edu Before joining UC Irvine in 2018, I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2018), working with Professor Arvind. I have earned my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University (2010). Research Interests My research is in innovative system architectures for low-cost high-performance computing . My two prominent tools right now are Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and reconfigurable hardware accelerators . I am looking for students interested in building affordable systems that outperform supercomputers! Software Distributions libsortreduce Library implementing the Sort-Reduce algorithm for sequentializing random updates into secondary storage, introduced in the GraFBoost paper. GraFBoost / BigSparse Graph analytics platform for handling very large graphs quickly using secondary storage, built using libsortreduce. BluespecPCIe High-performance PCIe library for the Xilinx 7 series FPGAs in the Bluespec language, including hardware core and software library. Selected Publications 1.
