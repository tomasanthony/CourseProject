 Daniel A. Jimnez Department of Computer Science and Engineering Texas A&M University TAMU 3112 College Station, TX 77843-3112 Office: HRBB 509D Email: djimenez@cs.tamu.edu Voice: +1.979.845.2434 Office hours: By appointment. I'm a Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Texas A&M University . Before this, I was Professor and Department Chair in the CS department at UT San Antonio. Before that, I was an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the CS department at Rutgers. My Ph.D. in Computer Sciences is from UT Austin. I'm interested in anything related to making computation go faster. My focus is on microarchitecture and the interaction between the compiler and the microarchitecture. I've been doing a lot of work in branch prediction and more recently caches. I'm known for inventing the perceptron branch predictor as well as for other research. I'm also inexplicably drawn to leadership and service roles in my university and research communities, although it remains to be seen if my recent stint as Department Chair at UTSA has cured me of that. For a detailed list of professional things I've done, see my CV . For Graduate Students Interested in my Classes Yes, there will be programming. I teach Computer Science. There is a lot of programming in Computer Science. If you don't like programming you shouldn't be taking my class.

Old Stuff In my previous life, I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, I worked on the faculty of the UT Health Science Center at San Antonio medical school, and taught computer science classes at UTSA. Here are local copies of the web pages I kept then: Grad Student, The University of Texas at Austin . My advisor was Calvin Lin . My thesis title was Delay-Sensitive Branch Predictors for Future Technologies. Instructor/Research, The Department of Rehabiliation Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio I did research at UTHSCSA into automating the design of prosthetic devices for below-the-knee amputees. Here's a Java applet I wrote that shows the shape of an amputee's leg with anatomical markers. Part of my job was to find these markers using neural networks. Teaching Associate, The Division of Computer Science, The University of Texas at San Antonio These pages relate to the classes I taught while at UTSA. They have some information that might be useful to undergraduates in CS, as well as anyone teaching similar CS courses. And here are links to my still-active(?) web pages at the other two universities where I have been a professor: Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Rutgers This is pretty much an out-of-date copy of my UT San Antonio web page Professor, Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at San Antonio This is as I left it on my last day as a Professor at UTSA. Quotes I have collected a few interesting quotes here . Branch Prediction Joke In Soviet Russia, branch predicts YOU! Best Quote Technical skill is mastery of complexity, while creativity is mastery of simplicity. (Sir Erik Christopher Zeeman) Links Here are some interesting links: The Comp.Theory FAQ I had a hand in writing this FAQ list for the newsgroup comp.theory . My stuff is where it says "the rest of this section was written by Daniel Jimenez." Amy Marquez This is my sister's web site. She is a web designer in San Antonio, Texas and would be appalled at this abomination I call a web page.
