Since Fall 2009, I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Prior to that I was at MIT where I received my Masters and PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as part of the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Ocean Science and Engineering. I work at the interface of statistical signal processing and random matrix theory with applications such as sonar, radar, wireless communications and machine learning in mind. I particularly enjoy using random matrix theory to address problems that arise in statistical signal processing. An important component of my work is applying it in real-world settings to tease out low-level signals from sensor, oceanographic, financial and econometric time/frequency measurements/time series. In addition to the satisfaction derived from transforming the theory into practice, real-world settings give us insight into how the underlying techniques can be refined and/or made more robust. We gratefully acknowledge support of the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program , the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Program , the DARPA Young Faculty Award and the Army Research Office's MURI initiative in sustaining our research. site info 2007-2008 N.
