 Stefano Tessaro Stefano Tessaro Associate Professor Alfred P. Sloan Fellow Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington E-mail: tessaro -(at)- cs -(dot)- washington -(dot)- edu [ About me ] [ Teaching ] [ Professional activities ] [ Advising ] [ Publications ] News: We are running a weekly reading group on cryptography. Feel free to reach out if you want to attend or give a talk. About me Research interests: I work on a wide spectrum of problems in cryptography . Most of my research is on theoretical cryptography, though I look more and more at applications. I am particularly excited about theoretical challenges in the design and analysis of practical cryptography, and about applications of complexity theory, discrete mathematics, and information theory to cryptography. I am also broadly interested in the design of privacy-preserving systems. My research is currently supported by an NSF CAREER award, NSF grants CNS 1423566, CNS 1719146, CNS 1528178, and IIS 1528041, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. Brief bio : Before joining UW in Winter 2019, I have been an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara for five years. Even earlier, I was a research scientist at MIT CSAIL , supervised by Shafi Goldwasser , and a postdoctoral scholar at UC San Diego working with Mihir Bellare . I completed my PhD in 2010 at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Ueli Maurer . More information is available in my CV (check date, may be outdated).
