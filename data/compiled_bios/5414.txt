Enlightenment Scholarships Informatics Global Research Scholarships See our general website for information on how to apply and contact me if you do. Apart from the standard PhD program for students who already hold an MSc, there is also a combined 4-year MSc/PhD program. (The EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh.) Students undertake an initial MSc by Research year, followed by three years of PhD study. See http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk for details. Research Interests Formal Verification Formal models for distributed systems: Petri nets, process algebras and automata theoretic models. Verification of systems with infinitely many states. Algorithms for the design and verification of reactive and distributed systems. Decidability and complexity of model checking problems. Decidability and complexity of bisimulation equivalence and other semantic equivalences. Scalable verification methods and their application to industrial specification languages like UML RT. Analysis and verification of probabilistic systems: Markov chains, Markov reward models, Stochastic games. Logic Automata Theory Term rewriting. Tableau systems. Exotic computing devices and the borders of decidability. My habilitation thesis: ``On Verification Problems for Systems with Infinite State Spaces''. , (September 2002).
