 Jun Xu's Home Page Jun Xu Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science The Charles V. Schaefer, Jr. School of Engineering and Science Stevens Institute of Technology North Building 204, 1 Castle Point Terrace Hoboken, NJ 07030 Email: jxu69_at_stevens_dot_edu Biography I received my Ph.D. at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, under the advising of Dr. Peng Liu and Dr. Xinyu Xing . Before I joined Penn State, I received my bachelor's degree at University of Science and Technology of China (2009-2013). My research interests include software security and system security. The goal of my research is to automate vulnerability finding, analysis, and mitigation. I also do research to neutralize the threats of malware. I play and design CTF games occasionally. If you share my interests and would like to join me as a PhD student or intern, please send me an email.
