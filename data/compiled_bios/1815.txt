To conduct this research, I gather data in the outdoors in natural settings, indoors in hallways or buildings, and in virtual environments. This work weds seemingly disparate fields of study: research on emotion and health and perception of the environment. Opportunities For Students I am considering taking a new graduate student for the fall of 2017. Please email me your credentials if interested. If you are interested in joining my lab as an undergraduate research assistant, please email me before the start of the fall 2016/spring 2017 semester to see if we have openings.
