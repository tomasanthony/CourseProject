 Home Current Research Members Publications Test Facilities Contact Student Info Links As a research lab, we seek to establish novel test techniques regarding mixed-signal circuits and systems. As the mixed-signal ICs get system-on-a-chip complexity, the problem of mixed-mode test evolves. The adaptation of BIST (Built-In Self-Test) techniques and any other DFT (Design For Testability) schemes in this area remains a serious challenge for circuit and test engineers. By leading in this effort both in industry and academia, we aim to develop practical and cost-effective methods in the field of designing and testing of mixed-signal integrated circuits.
