 Jacobo Bielak, P.E. Hamerschlag University Professor Emeritus, Civil and Environmental Engineering Contact Porter Hall 123H Email 412-268-2958 412-268-7813 Address Civil & Environmental Engineering Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 Bio Jacobo Bielak is the Hamerschlag University Professor Emeritus in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. His research interests are in earthquake engineering, engineering seismology, and more recently, in structural health monitoring. Bielak was a member of the original Applied Technology Council (ATC) committee that drafted the first seismic provisions for soil-structure interaction in the US, based mainly on his work. These provisions are now, in modified form, part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) seismic provisions. He has received the Gordon Bell Prize for Special Accomplishment Based on Innovation. He is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Distinguished Member of ASCE, and a Fellow of the U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics. He is also a Corresponding Member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and of the Mexican Academy of Engineering. Bielak received his Civil Engineers degree from the National University of Mexico (UNAM), MS from Rice University, and PhD from Caltech.
