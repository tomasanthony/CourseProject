 Toggle navigation Research Lab Teaching Personal Jin L.C. Guo Assistant Professor of Software Engineering School of Computer Science , McGill University Jin L.C. Guo received her PhD from the University of Notre Dame. She is interested in utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to solve Software Engineering (SE) problems. Her recent research focuses on mining domain knowledge from software traceability data and utilizing such knowledge to facilitate automated SE tasks such as trace retrieval and project Q&A. Before her PhD, she worked in the research lab at Fuji Xerox in areas of image processing and computer vision.
