Mohammad Mahmoody Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. Sharif University, 2004M.S. Princeton, 2007Ph.D. Princeton, 2010Post-Doc Cornell, 2010-2013 "I study the (unproved) mathematical assumptions behind the security of cryptographic systems. A major goal is to know how much such assumptions could be weakened. " Mohammad Mahmoody, Assistant Professor Mahmoody started his undergraduate studies in Sharif University's computer Engineering department in 2000. He started his PhD in Princeton in 2005 and after that in 2010 joined Cornell as a postdoctoral associate. In 2013 he joined University of Virginia as an assistant professor. In 2014 he received NSF Career Award to work on "Separations in Cryptograhy".
