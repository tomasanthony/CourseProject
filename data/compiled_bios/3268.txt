Research Geometric Computing and Applications Broadly speaking, geometric computing is concerned with the design of efficient computational techniques for representing, reasoning with, and manipulating geometric entities. My research here encompasses algorithm and data structure design and analysis, software development, and deployment of solutions into applications. Application areas of current interest include computer-aided design and manufacture, spatial query processing, biomedical engineering, and protein structure analysis. To get a flavor for this, you can check out some of my recent work on layered manufacturing here . Feel free to email me ( lastname @cs.umn.edu) if you would like more information or copies of my other papers, or are interested in collaborating on research. Teaching In Fall 2018, I am teaching a graduate course on advanced algorithms and data structures (CSci 5421). In Spring 2019, I will be teaching an undergraduate honors course on discrete methods (CSci 2011H) and a graduate course on computational geometry (CSci 8442).
