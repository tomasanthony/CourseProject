 Chao Chen Assistant Professor Department of Biomedical Informatics Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY 11794-8322 Office: Computer Science Building, 2313C Tel: +1-631-632-2593 I am looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs. Please send me your CV and check out the phd program of our department . If you are a PhD or Master student at Stony Brook, please contact me for research opportunities. Research Interests I explore geometric and topological properties of data. These global and robust information can provide insight for modern data analytics. My research draws from the following different domains. Machine learning : graphical models, structured learning. Topological data analysis : persistent homology, computation of topological features. Biomedical image analysis : medical images, neuron images, functional MRI.
