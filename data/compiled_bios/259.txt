Biography: Dr. Xu is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Department in the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo , where he founds and directs the ESC (Embedded Sensing and Computing) Group . He has published over 150 technical papers, co-authored 2 books and is a named inventor on many international and U.S. patents. He received the Ph.D. degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2013. He got both M.S. degree in 2008 and B.S. degreein 2006 from Zhejiang University (both with honor), China. Research Overview: Read More Our group has focused on exploring novel Embedded Sensing and Computing technologies to build up innovative Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems for high-impact real-world applications in the fields of healthcare, security and advanced manufacturing. Results has been published in peer-reviewed top research venues across multiple disciplines, including Computer Science conferences (e.g., ACM SenSys, MobiSys, UbiComp, MobiCom, ASPLOS, ISCA, HPCA and CCS), Biomedical Engineering journals (e.g., IEEE TBME, TBioCAS, and JBHI), and Medicine journals (e.g., LANCET). Our group won six best paper awards, one best paper nomination and two international best design awards. Our inventions have been filed within U.S. and internationally as patents, and have been licensed to industrial players. Our research has been reported in various high-impact media outlets, including the Discovery Channel, Cable News Network, the Wall Street Journal, National Public Radio, Los Angeles Times, and the National Science Foundation's News. Our research has been supported by National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), SUNY RF, and University at Buffalo.
