University of British Columbia, 1971 M.Sc. University of British Columbia, 1973 Ph.D. University of British Columbia, 1976 (Ph.D. Supervisor, Dr. Raymond Reiter) RESEARCH INTERESTS I am interested in colour perception. My approach to understanding colour is to view colour perception as a computational process. As such, the models of colour perception developed in my laboratory are formulated as algorithms that can be tested both in terms of whether or not they simply provide the expected results, and secondly in terms of whether they operate in a way that is congruent with what is known about human colour perception from the psychophysical experiments conducted by psychologists. The results of my research find application in the digital camera industry, the digital printing industry, the digital display industry, the textile industry, the lighting industry, and in the scientific use of colour (e.g., in medical applications).
