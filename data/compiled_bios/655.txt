In particular, I focus on deep learning and representation learning, which aims to learn an abstract representation of the data by a hierarchical and compositional structure. My research also spans over related topics, such as graphical models, optimization, and large-scale learning. Specific application areas include computer vision, audio recognition, robotics, text modeling, and healthcare.
