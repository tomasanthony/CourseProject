She has developed cell cycle models to study the effects of different cancer treatment strategies on cell cycle dynamics, and the dynamical models of DNA repair pathways (mismatch repair, base excision repair and non-homologous end joining pathways) to quantitatively study the role of these pathways in the improvement of therapeutic gain in cancer treatment.
