I am a member of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Decision making and Action . I am a member of the Laboratory for Computational Intelligence (LCI) . I am a member of the Institute for Computing, Information, and Cognitive Systems . Schedule Before proposing a meeting time, please check the busy slots on my free-busy calendar . If my whole day is busy, a box will appear under the date, above the hourly section. It does not block out the entire day. Research Here is a brief sketch of my research program . My research publications can be found under papers . If you'd like to join our research group as a graduate student, please see: CS prospective graduate student information where you'll also find information about funding and great scholarship opportunities. It is very unlikely I will be taking any students in robotics. I do not reply in person to letters of interest in graduate admissions.

Our weekly reading group on vision and robotics is: Robuddies Our weekly reading group on computer vision: CVRG Jose, our mobile robot, won a robotics competition: Jose's page. Every year, we talk about robotics in Science 101. In 2017, John Roberts, one of the Science 101 students, wrote this wonderful poem about Jose, the robot waiter: Jose's poem. Tracking and Understanding Human Motion I was a member of IRIS project Tools for Visual Information Management in Geographical and Biomedical Applications . Its continuation, starting in April, 2002, was "Acquisition, Querying and Prediction of Motion Trajectories", where we specialized in extracting motion trajectories from sports videos (hockey) and building database systems that permit detection of outlier, i.e., unusual spatiotemporal patterns. Geoinformatics I was a member of GEOIDE since 1999. The first project I was in was Extraction of Features from Remote-Sensed Imagery for a Search and Rescue Synthetic Vision Database . Teaching NOTE: Because I have taken on more administrative responsibilities, we will not be able to offer CPSC 505 this year (2018-2019). For those graduate students looking for a comprehensive introduction to vision I suggest that you take CPSC 425 in term 1. It will be good preparation for 532S in term 2. If you are a grad student interested in 425, please contact me as soon as possible. 2018 Jan Computer Vision CPSC 425 425 home page (in progress) . Office hours: TBD. Other Stuff I'm a co-author, with Vincent Manis, of the textbook The Schematics of Computation , published by Prentice-Hall, 1995, ISBN 0-13-834284-9.
