Bio and Background I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur . I obtained my PhD from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University where I was advised by Professor Sharad Malik . Subsequently, I was a postdoctoral scholar working with Professor Sanjit Seshia in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley . Before entering academia, I used to be a Software Engineer at National Instruments and a Design Engineer at AMD . While at AMD, I worked on the Jaguar low-power core. Among other things, I developed a new cache replacement policy for that core. I also spent multiple summers working with the Security Center of Excellence at Intel during my PhD. My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods, security and systems. Most of my recent work has applied formal methods to address system security concerns. See the research page for more information. [CV] (PDF) Google Scholar DBLP Here is a wordcloud constructed from the abstracts of my papers (constructed circa 2015, so kinda out of date).
