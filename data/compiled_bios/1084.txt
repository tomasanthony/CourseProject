Her research interests are in the areas of ubiquitous computing, interaction design and human-computer interaction. A central theme of her work is how to design interactive technologies that can enhance life by augmenting and extending everyday, learning and work activities. This involves informing, building and evaluating novel user experiences through designing, implementing and deploying a diversity of technologies. A current focus of her research is on human-centred data and people in the Internet of Things in urban settings. She is also interested in operationalising and investigating what human-centred AI means in practice. Central to her work is a critical stance towards how visions, theories and frameworks shape the fields of HCI, cognitive science and Ubicomp. She has been instrumental in promulgating new theories (e.g., external cognition), alternative methodologies (e.g., in the wild studies) and far-reaching research agendas (e.g., " Being Human: HCI in 2020" ). She has also published two monographs " HCI Theory: Classical, Modern and Contemporary." and " Research in the Wild." with Paul Marshall. Brief biography Yvonne joined UCL in September 2011. From 2006-2011, she was professor of HCI in the Computing Department at the Open University, where she set up the Pervasive Interaction Lab . From 2003-2006, she was a professor in Informatics at Indiana University. Prior to this, she spent 11 years at the former School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences at Sussex University. She has spent sabbaticals at Stanford, Apple, Queensland University, University of Cape Town, University of Melbourne, QUT, UC San Diego and this year at UC Santa Cruz. Yvonne was one of the principal investigators on the UK Equator Project (2000-2007) where she pioneered ubiquitous learning. She has published widely, beginning with her PhD work on graphical interfaces to her recent work on public visualisations and behavioural change. More recently, she was a PI for the Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI) on sustainable and connected cities. This was a joint collaboration between UCL and Imperial, that ran for 5 years from 2012-2018. In her earlier career, she was awarded a prestigious EPSRC dream fellowship rethinking the relationship between ageing, computing and creativity . She is one of the authors of the definitive textbook on Interaction Design and HCI (4th edition), that has sold nearly 200,000 copies worldwide and has been translated into 6 languages. She collaborates a lot with industrial partners and recently was awarded a Microsoft Research Outstanding Collaborator Award (2016). This year she was was elected as a Fellow of the ACM. This is in addition to her being elected as a Fellow of the British Computer Society and a fellow of the ACM's CHI Academy: "an honorary group of individuals who have made substantial contributions to the field of human-computer interaction. These are the principal leaders of the field, whose efforts have shaped the disciplines and/or industry, and led the research and/or innovation in human-computer interaction."
