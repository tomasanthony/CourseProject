 Bin Ren Assistant Professor in College of William and Mary Home Publications CV I joined the Computer Science Department of College of William and Mary as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2016. I received my Ph.D from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering , Ohio State University in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Gagan Agrawal . I was a post-doctoral research associate in High Performance Computing group of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with Dr. Sriram Krishnamoorthy . Research interests: Programming systems and compiler support for parallel computing Parallelization for data-intensive and compute-intensive applications Runtime scheduling strategies for SIMD and multi-core systems Programming models for irregular applications Recent and Selected Publications (full list) [CGO'2019] Ruiqin Tian*, Junqiao Qiu*, Zhijia Zhao, Xu Liu, Bin Ren (* co-primary), Transforming Query Sequences for High-Throughput B+ Tree Processing on Many-core Processors , The 2019 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), February, 2019.
