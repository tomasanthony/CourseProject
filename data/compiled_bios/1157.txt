(I have set up this spreadsheet so that you can only enter numbers, not change the formulas that do the work. But if your version of Excel doesn't match mine you might have to go to tools->unprotect to make this spreadsheet work.) Flip coins : An Excel spreadsheet that simulates flipping ten coins at a time, collecting and displaying statistics.
