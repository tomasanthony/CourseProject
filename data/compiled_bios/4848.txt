During the 2005-2006 academic year, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Visiting Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell. I did my graduate work in EECS at the University of California, Berkeley. I received my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. < My interests are in information theory, especially data compression, leakage in side channels, and quantum information. I have received a number of awards for my research and teaching including the 2017 James L. Massey Research & Teaching Award for Young Scholars from the IEEE Information Theory Society, the Cornell Michael Tien 72 College of Engineering Teaching Award (2009), the NSF CAREER award (2007), the David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize from the U.C. Berkeley EECS Dept. (2006), and the Bernard Friedman Memorial Prize in Applied Mathematics from the U.C. Berkeley Dept. of Mathematics (2005). Two of my students won the 2010 Information Theory Society Student Paper Award . 2008-2018 Cornell University
