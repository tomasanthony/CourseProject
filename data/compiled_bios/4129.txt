Vicente Ordonez-Roman Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio Ph.D. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2015M.S. Stony Brook University (SUNY), 2013Eng. Escuela Superior Politcnica del Litoral, 2008 "Our group builds systems that can describe visual information using natural language and learn to do so efficiently from large amounts of data." Vicente Ordonez-Roman, Assistant Professor Please visit the academic webpage that I actively maintain: http://vicenteordonez.com I'm Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I also spent a year as visiting research fellow at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) n the Computer Vision group. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in analyzing, and mining useful human insights from enormous amounts of images with associated text. I am also interested in big scale visual analytics by learning models that can perform high-level perceptual tasks for applications in social media, urban computing, and everyday activities. I'm a recipient of the 2013 IEEE Marr Prize in Computer Vision, Best Long Paper Award at EMNLP 2017, and Faculty Awards from Google and IBM Research.
