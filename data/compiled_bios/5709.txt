More about me Before joining FIU SCIS, I served as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor of Computer Science for four years at James Madison University (VA). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Marquette University in Wisconsin. I completed my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in Bangladesh. I am the founder of CS4VA initiative, a one-day CS outreach program dedicated to build a Virginia statewide network to create a diverse and expanded CS K-12 pipeline. I am also the co-founder of Bangladeshi Women in Computer Science and Engineering (BWCSE) , which aims to elevate the status of Bangladeshi women in computing research by assisting them to achieve their career and professional goals. I directed the first Computer Science REU Program in James Madison University. You can learn more about the REU program here. I am the winner of the ABI sponsored Systers PIO (Pass-It-On) award and NCWIT educator grant.

Broadly, my research focuses on integrating mobile and pervasive technologies in health and wellness environments to improve users quality of life, mental and physical wellbeing. My research also expands in the direction of mobile security, information and communication technology for development (ICT4D), CS education, K-12 instructions and outreach, broadening participation in computing, best practices in undergraduate research, and how different pedagogical practices can increase diversity in CS. Note for Potential Students I am actively recruiting stduents, both at undergrad and grad level to work on different research projects. If you are interested to work with me or take an independent study course, please send me an email or stop by my office hour. My schedule fills up 2 weeks in advance (3-4 weeks towards the end of the semester), so please plan accordingly and for faster response use email to communicate with me. Past students Marissa Halpert (Joined iStrategyLabs) Jamie Martin (Joined ASM Research) Jing Feng (Joined Columbia University) Karina Bekova (Joined FireEye, Inc.) Susan Chatfield (Joined National Sojourners Inc) Laura Vandyuke (Joined AECOM) Teaching Note to potential learning assistants Every semester, I am looking for potential students interested to serve as a paid learning assistant for the courses I am teaching.
