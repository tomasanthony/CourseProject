 Khai N. TRUONG jump to: about me | interests | recent pubs | teaching | advisees | contact info ABOUT me I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering with highest honors from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. RESEARCH interests My research interests are in human-computer interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp). I investigate tools and methods to support the development of novel ubiquitous computing systems and techniques and models to facilitate user interactions with off-the-desktop computing devices and services . My current work also includes the design and evaluation of assistive technologies and context sensing applications . most recent PUBLICATIONS The following is a list of some of my recent publications.
