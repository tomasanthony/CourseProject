Michael Gribskov Professor of Biological SciencesProfessor of Computer Science (courtesy)Joined department: 2004 EducationBS, Oregon State University, Biochemistry and Biophysics (1979) PhD, University of Wisconsin, Molecular Biology (1985) Dr. Gribskov has wide ranging interests in computational molecular biology. These interests fall into several main categories. One area of interest is the application of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to biomolecules. These approaches are often used in the functional annotation of molecules based on their sequences. A second area is the design and implementation of biological databases, and the development of interactive data laboratories that integrate analytical tools and databases. Finally, Dr. Gribskov is interested in the development of interoperable resources to support genomics and systems biology using approaches such as database federation, data mediation, and web services. Since 2003, Dr. Gribskov has been the president of the International Society for Computational Biology, the largest professional society devoted to bioinformatics and computational biology.
