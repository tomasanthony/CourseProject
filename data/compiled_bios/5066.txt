His research interests are in electronic voting, cyber-physical security, cryptographic engineering, finite field arithmetic, random number generators, and neuromorphic engineering. Ko is the co-founder of the Conference on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems . The CHES Conference is the second largest cryptography conference and the premier forum for presenting scientific advances in all aspects of cryptographic hardware and security of embedded systems. Ko is also co-founder of two other conferences: International Workshop on the Arithmetic of Finite Fields (WAIFI) and Security Proofs for Embedded Systems (PROOFS). WAIFI is a forum of engineers and mathematicians interested in efficient software and hardware realizations of finite fields. On the other hand, the goal of the PROOFS workshop is to promote methodologies that increase the confidence level in the security of embedded systems, especially those that contain cryptographic mechanisms. Ko also organized and chaired the Open Problems in Mathematical and Computational Sciences Conference , held in Istanbul in September 18-20, 2013, and Cyber-Physical Security Education Workshop , held in July 17-19, 2017 in Paris, France. Ko is the founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cryptographic Engineering (JCEN), published by Springer. JCEN covers all aspects of design and implementation of cryptographic hardware and software. Ko has been in the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Computers (2003-2008 and 2015-now) and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (2003-2007). He was a guest co-editor of April 2003 & November 2008 issues of the IEEE Transactions on Computers on cryptographic and cryptanalytic hardware and embedded systems. In 2007, Ko was elected as IEEE Fellow for his contributions to cryptographic engineering. Furthermore, Ko is an Associate Editor of the prestigious International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science since March 2016. Ko is the co-author of the three books Cryptographic Algorithms on Reconfigurable Hardware , Cryptographic Engineering , and Open Problems in Mathematics and Computational Science , published by Springer in 2007, 2009, and 2014, respectively. In addition to contributing to 6 conference proceedings as co-editor, he has also authored or co-authored more than 150 scientific papers, and 13 US patents. Ko graduated 15 Ph.D. students and 37 M.S. students, and also directed research theses of 6 undergraduate students. 11 of his Ph.D. students are currently professors (3 in the US, 1 in Mexico, and 7 in other countries). Ko was an Assistant Professor at University of Houston (1988-1992), Assistant, Associate and Full Professor at Oregon State University (1992-2007). He established Information Security Laboratory at Oregon State University, and received Award for Outstanding and Sustained Research Leadership in September 2001. Currently, Ko has appointments at stinye University (stanbul, Turkey), Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Nanjing, China), and University of California Santa Barbara. His research at UC Santa Barbara is funded privately and also by NSF, on aspects of electronic voting machines, cryptographic engineering, and cyber-physical security, performed within Ko Lab composed of postdoctoral researchers, PhD and MS candidates, and undergraduate students. * Ko is pronounced as "Coach". jcen cpss open cren carh waifi14 waifi08 ches03 ches02 ches01 ches00 ches99 Publications Copyright etin Kaya Ko.
