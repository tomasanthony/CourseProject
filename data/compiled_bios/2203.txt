 Mike Ferdman's Home Page Mike Ferdman Associate Professor, CS, Stony Brook University home cv publications teaching personal contact I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stony Brook University . I co-direct the Computer Architecture Stony Brook (COMPAS) Lab. Prior to joining Stony Brook, I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University ( CMU ) under the supervision of Babak Falsafi . While completing my dissertation, I spent several years working remotely from Ecole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne ( EPFL ). My research interests are in the area of computer architecture, with emphasis on the design of server systems. I work on the entire computing stack, from server software and operating systems, to networks and processor microarchitecture. My current research projects include FPGA accelerator integration into server environments (e.g., Intel HARP, Microsoft Catapult, and Amazon F1), FPGA programmability (e.g., virtual memory and high-level synthesis), accelerators for machine learning (e.g., convolutional neural networks), efficient network processing and software-defined networking, speculative performance and energy-enhancing techniques for high-performance processors, and programming models and mechanisms for emerging memory technologies (e.g., HBM and 3D XPoint). If you are a PhD student at Stony Brook and want to work with me, please send me email to arrange an appointment. publications 2019 [40] An Efficient, Scalable and Exact Representation of High-Dimensional Color Information Enabled via de Bruijn Graph Search Fatemeh Almodaresi, Prashant Pandey, Michael Ferdman, Rob Johnson, Rob Patro , In 22nd Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB) , 2019.

Most recently, my main focus has been on Machine Learning Accelerators, developing hardware techniques to enable fast and efficient implementations of deep learning, and making FPGA-based accelerators more practical and easier to program. More broadly, my work seeks to understand the fundamental properties and interactions of application software, operating systems, networks, processor microarchitecture, and datacenter dynamics, to enable software and hardware co-design of high-performance, power-efficient, and compact servers.
