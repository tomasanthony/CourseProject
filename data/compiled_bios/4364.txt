 Philippos Mordohai Associate Professor Department of Computer Science Stevens Institute of Technology Office: North Building 209 Phone Number: +1 201 216 5611 E-mail: mordohai_at_cs.stevens.edu Home Research Publications Teaching Service, Awards and Other Activities CV (pdf) NEWS I will serve as one of the program chairs of 3DV 2019. I will serve as an area chair for CVPR 2019 and ICCV 2019. Mohammed Kutbi defended his Ph.D. in November! I am teaching CS 188: Seminar in Computer Science and CS 677: Parallel Programming for Many-core Processors in the Spring 2019 semester. I have received outstanding reviewer awards from ACCV 2010, CVPR 2011, ICCV 2011, CVPR 2012, ECCV 2012, ICCV 2013, ECCV 2014, CVPR 2016, ECCV 2016, CVPR 2017 and CVPR 2018. Not sure what this means for my priorities in time allocation... M.S. ADVISING I am no longer a graduate advisor. Please see the FAQ before contacting your advisor. Many of the answers are already there. Orientation notes for the Fall 2016 semester. EDUCATION Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (2005).

WORDS OF WISDOM By Jacob August Riis: "I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before."
