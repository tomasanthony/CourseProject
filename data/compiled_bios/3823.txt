 I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Before this, I spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University working with Martial Hebert and Alyosha Efros . I got my PhD from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of David Forsyth . During my PhD I also had the privilege of working closely with Derek Hoiem . I am mainly interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, the intersection of Natural Language and Vision, and analysing the role of Semantics in Visual Understandings. More specifically, my research interests include: Object and action recognition Attribute based object representations and cross category generalization Generating richer descriptions for images Aspect issues in human activity and object recognition Knowledge trasnfer, transfer learning and it's applications in computer vision Scene understanding Multitask learning and annotation prediction Sign language recognition Image segmentation Please see my webpage for more details.
