 Welcome to Fei Liu's Homepage HOME PUBLICATION SERVICE TEACHING UCF NLP Group Curriculum Vitae Short Biography Fei Liu Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science University of Central Florida Email : feiliu@cs.ucf.edu Address : 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32816 The UCF Natural Language Processing Group is always looking for talented PhD and undergraduate students to join us on research projects. If you are interested in working with us, please drop an email to Dr. Liu. Research Interests Dr. Liu's research is in the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. In particular, her research focuses on the challenging problem of automatic text summarization . Summarization is considered an important technology to reduce information overload. The goal is to generate concise and fluent summaries from a large amount of text documents. Dr. Liu's work has spanned a variety of text forms, including news articles, social media updates, and policy documents. Her research draws on the recent advances of machine learning and deep learning to produce extractive and abstractive summaries that are concise, accurate, and informative. Some research topics she has been involved include: Automatic Text Summarization Language Generation Deep Neural Networks Machine Learning for NLP Recent Publications [Full List] [Google Scholar] Adapting the Neural Encoder-Decoder Framework from Single to Multi-Document Summarization Logan Lebanoff, Kaiqiang Song, and Fei Liu Accepted by the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) , Brussels, Belgium, 2018 Structure-Infused Copy Mechanisms for Abstractive Summarization Kaiqiang Song, Lin Zhao, and Fei Liu Accepted by the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING) , Santa Fe, New Mexico, 2018 Try our new Structure-Infused Sentence Summarizer!
