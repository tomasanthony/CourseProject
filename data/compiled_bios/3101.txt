 Zachary Palmer Department of Computer Science Swarthmore College 270 Science Center 500 College Avenue Swarthmore, PA 19081 zachary.palmer --at-- swarthmore.edu zepalmer I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Swarthmore College . My research interests include software engineering, compile-time metaprogramming, subtype constraint theory, and related program analyses. I completed my Ph.D. in the Spring of 2015 at Johns Hopkins University , where I had the pleasure of being advised by Dr. Scott F. Smith . Teaching I am teaching CS75: Compilers in the Spring 2019 semester. Please see the course website for more information on CS75. Previous Courses Fall 2018: CS35: Data Structures and Algorithms Spring 2018: CS73: Programming Languages Fall 2017: CS71: Software Engineering Spring 2017: CS75: Compilers Fall 2016: CS35: Data Structures and Algorithms Spring 2016: CS35: Data Structures and Algorithms Fall 2015: CS21: Introduction to Computer Science Research My interests are in type theory, program analysis, and their application to software engineering. I am primarily working on DDPA , a higher-order demand-driven program analysis. This project applies intuitions from constraint type theory to program analysis, yielding an algorithm with natural work-sharing properties and expressiveness competitive with state-of-the-art analyses. My work on DDPA is a joint effort with the JHU Programming Languages laboratory . Publications A Schematic Pushdown Reachability Language , November 2018. Zachary Palmer, Charlotte Raty.
