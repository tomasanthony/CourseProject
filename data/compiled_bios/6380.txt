Desheng is an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University. Previously, Desheng was offered the Senseable City Consortium Postdoctoral Fellowship fromMIT, and awarded his Ph.D in Computer Science fromUniversity of Minnesota.Under the White HouseSmart Cities Initiative, Desheng is interested in bridgingCyber-Physical Systems(as known asInternet of Thingsunder some context) andData Sciencein Extreme-Scale Data-Intensive Urban Infrastructure from anInterdisciplinaryperspective. He is focused on the life cycle of data-driven urban systems, from mobile data collection, to cross-domain data fusion, heterogeneous model integration, visual data analytics, system optimization and application deployment. He strategically positions his research onReal-Time Interactions of Cross-Domain Urban Systems, i.e., transportation (e.g., taxis, buses, trucks, subways, bikes, personal & electric vehicles), telecommunication (e.g., cellphones), finance (e.g., smartcards), social networks (e.g., check-in and app logs), and geography (e.g., road networks). He has been investigating platforms across 8 cities on 3 continents with 100 thousand app users, 500 thousand vehicles, 10 million phones, 16 million smartcards, and 100 million residents involved.His technical contributions have led to more than 20 papers, featuring11 first-author papersin premium venues, e.g., MobiCom, SIGSPATIAL, SenSys, IPSN, ICCPS, BigData, RTSS, ICDCS. Desheng has been honored with6 best paper/thesis/poster awardsand the Chinese Government Award as one of only 4 Computer Science students among 250 thousand Chinese students in US.During his free time, Desheng likes to travel. Here is amapabout cities he has been visited so far in US.
