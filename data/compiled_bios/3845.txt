Bubeck, M. B. Cohen, and Y. T. Lee (SODA'19) We consider metrical task systems on tree metrics, and present an $O(\mathrm{depth} \times \log n)$-competitive randomized algorithm based on the mirror descent framework. For the special case of HSTs, we refine the standard approach based on combining unfair metrical task systems, yielding an $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm. This is tight up to the implicit constant factor. Using known random embeddings of finite metric spaces into HSTs, this yields an $O((\log n)^2)$-competitive algorithm for general $n$-point spaces. [ abs | bib ] Flow-cut gaps and face covers in planar graphs , with R. Krauthgamer and H. Rika (SODA'19) We establish new and improved bounds on the flow-cut gap in planar flow networks where the terminals lie on a small number of faces. The classical Okamura-Seymour theorem (1981) shows that when all terminals lie on a single face, the flow-cut gap is exactly 1. We show that if the terminals lie on $\gamma$ faces, the flow-cut gap is $O(\log \gamma)$. This is proved by embedding the terminal metric into a distribution over trees with distortion $O(\log \gamma)$, which is tight up to the implied constant factor. [ abs | bib ] Fusible HSTs and the randomized k-server conjecture (FOCS'18) We give a poly(log k)-competitive randomized algorithm for the k-server problem on general metric spaces. The best previous result independent of the underlying metric space is the 2k-1 competitive ratio established for the deterministic work function algorithm by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (1995). Since deterministic algorithms can do no better than k on any metric space with at least k+1 points, this establishes that for every metric space on which the problem is non-trivial, randomized algorithms give an exponential improvement over determinsitic algorithms. The approach employs our previous algorithm for the fractional k-server problem on HSTs . @inproceedings{LeeFOCS18, author = {James R.

Bubeck, M. B. Cohen, Y. T. Lee, and A. Madry (STOC'18) We present an \(O((\log k)^2)\)-competitive randomized algorithm for the k-server problem on hierarchically separated trees (HSTs). This is the first o(k)-competitive randomized algorithm for which the competitive ratio is independent of the size of the underlying HST. Our algorithm is designed in the framework of online mirror descent where the mirror map is a multiscale entropy. When combined with Bartals static HST embedding reduction, this leads to an \(O((\log k)^2 \log n)\)-competitive algorithm on any n-point metric space. We give a new dynamic HST embedding that yields an \(O((\log k)^3 \log \Delta)\)-competitive algorithm on any metric space where the ratio of the largest to smallest non-zero distance is at most \(\Delta\). @inproceedings{BCLLM18, author = {S{\'{e}}bastien Bubeck and Michael B.

We show that if \(G_0\) excludes the complete graph \(K_h\) as a minor, then every region intersection graph over \(G_0\) with m edges has a balanced separator with \(O(\sqrt{m})\) nodes. If \(G\) has uniformly bounded vertex degrees, we show the separator is found by spectral partitioning. A string graph is the intersection graph of continuous arcs in the plane. The preceding result implies that every string graph with m edges has a balanced separator of size \(O(\sqrt{m})\). This bound is optimal, as it generalizes the planar separator theorem. It confirms a conjecture of Fox and Pach (2010) and improves over the \(O(\sqrt{m} \log m)\) bound of Matousek (2013). @inproceedings{LeeStrings17, author = {James R.

In other words, there exists a unimodular unit volume weighting of the graph metric on G such that the volume growth of balls is asymptotically polynomial with exponent d. This generalizes to graphs that can be quasisymmetrically packed in an Ahlfors d-regular metric measure space. Using our previous work, it gives bounds on the almost sure spectral dimension of G. @article{LeeGAFA18, AUTHOR = {Lee, James R.}, FJOURNAL = {Geometric and Functional Analysis}, JOURNAL = {Geom.

This leads to the notion of the conformal growth exponent of \((G, \rho)\), which is the best asymptotic degree of volume growth of balls that can be achieved by such a weighting. Under moment conditions on the degree of the root, we show that the conformal growth exponent of a unimodular random graph bounds its almost sure spectral dimension. For two-dimensional growth, one obtains more precise information about recurrence, the heat kernel, and subdiffusivity of the random walk. In particular, this gives a new method for studying the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and quadrangulation (UIPQ). [ abs | bib ] Diffusive estimates for random walks on stationary random graphs of polynomial growth , with S. Ganguly and Y. Peres (GAFA, 2017) We show that if $(G,\rho)$ is a stationary random graph of annealed polynomial growth, then almost surely there is an infinite sequence of times at which the random walk started from x is at most diffusive. This result is new even in the case when G is a stationary random subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Combined with the work of Benjamini, Duminil-Copin, Kozma, and Yadin , it implies that G almost surely does not admit a non-constant harmonic function of sublinear growth. To complement this, we argue that passing to a subsequence of times is necessary, as there are stationary random graphs of (almost sure) polynomial growth where the random walk is almost surely superdiffisuve at an infinite subset of times. Addendum: In the paper, we ask whether passing to a subsequence of times is necessary when $G$ is a stationary random subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. For the case $d=2$, it holds for all times using my paper with Ding and Peres . For $d$ sufficiently large, passing to a subsequence of times is necessary; this can be proved by showing that our stationary random graph occurs as a stationary random subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^d_{\infty}$, using my paper with Krauthgamer . @article {GLP17, AUTHOR = {Ganguly, Shirshendu and Lee, James R. and Peres, Yuval}, TITLE = {Diffusive estimates for random walks on stationary random graphs of polynomial growth}, JOURNAL = {Geom.

Eldan and J. Lehec (Matousek, 2017) We show that if the random walk on a graph has positive coarse Ricci curvature in the sense of Ollivier, then the stationary measure satisfies a \(W^1\) transport-entropy inequality. Peres and Tetali have conjectured a stronger consequence, that a modified log-Sobolev inequality (MLSI) should hold, in analogy with the setting of Markov diffusions. We discuss how our entropy interpolation approach suggests a natural attack on the MLSI conjecture. @incollection {ELL17, AUTHOR = {Eldan, Ronen and Lee, James R. and Lehec, Joseph}, TITLE = {Transport-entropy inequalities and curvature in discrete-space {M}arkov chains}, BOOKTITLE = {A journey through discrete mathematics}, PAGES = {391--406}, PUBLISHER = {Springer}, YEAR = {2017}, } Other selected papers : [ abs | bib ] Lower bounds on the size of semidefinite programming relaxations , with P. Raghavendra and D. Steurer (STOC'15) [credit: Bernd Sturmfels ] We introduce a method for proving lower bounds on the efficacy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations for combinatorial problems. In particular, we show that the cut, TSP, and stable set polytopes on n-vertex graphs are not the linear image of the feasible region of any SDP (i.e., any spectrahedron) of dimension less than \(2^{n^c}\), for some constant \(c > 0\). This result yields the first super-polynomial lower bounds on the semidefinite extension complexity of any explicit family of polytopes. Our results follow from a general technique for proving lower bounds on the positive semidefinite rank of a matrix. To this end, we establish a close connection between arbitrary SDPs and those arising from the sum-of-squares SDP hierarchy. For approximating maximum constraint satisfaction problems, we prove that SDPs of polynomial-size are equivalent in power to those arising from degree-O(1) sum-of-squares relaxations. This result implies, for instance, that no family of polynomial-size SDP relaxations can achieve better than a 7/8-approximation for MAX-3-SAT.

Eldan (FOCS'15; Duke) We show that under the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup (i.e., the natural diffusion process) on n-dimensional Gaussian space, any nonnegative, measurable function exhibits a uniform tail bound better than that implied by Markovs inequality and conservation of mass. This confirms positively the Gaussian limiting case of Talagrands convolution conjecture (1989).

O. Chan, P. Raghavendra, and D. Steurer (FOCS'13; JACM) [credit: Fiorini, Rothvoss, and Tiwary ] We prove super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of linear programming relaxations for approximation versions of constraint satisfaction problems. We show that for these problems, polynomial-sized linear programs are exactly as powerful as programs arising from a constant number of rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. In particular, any polynomial-sized linear program for Max Cut has an integrality gap of 1/2 and any such linear program for Max 3-Sat has an integrality gap of 7/8.

Oveis-Gharan and L. Trevisan (STOC'12; JACM) A basic fact in spectral graph theory is that the number of connected components in an undirected graph is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue zero in the Laplacian matrix of the graph. In particular, the graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to zero. Cheegers inequality and its variants provide a robust version of the latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero. It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher multiplicities: There are k eigenvalues close to zero if and only if the vertex set can be partitioned into k subsets, each defining a sparse cut. We resolve this conjecture positively. Our result provides a theoretical justification for clustering algorithms that use the bottom k eigenvectors to embed the vertices into \(\mathbb{R}^k\), and then apply geometric considerations to the embedding. We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal quantitative connection between the expansion of sets of measure 1/k and the kth smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian.

Ding and Y. Peres (STOC'11; Ann. Math.) We show that the cover time of a graph can be related to the square of the maximum of the associated Gaussian free field.

Biswal and S. B. Rao (FOCS'08; JACM) A method is presented for establishing an upper bound on the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian of a finite graph. Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the geometry of the graph, and the resulting metric is embedded into Euclidean space to recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we resolve positively a question of Spielman and Teng by proving that \(\lambda_2(G) \leq O(d h^6 \log h/n)\) whenever \(G\) is a \(K_h\)-minor-free graph with maximum degree \(d\). While the standard sweep algorithm applied to the second eigenvector of a graph my fail to find a good quotient cut in graphs of unbounded degree, the arguments here produce a vector that works for arbitrary graphs. This yields an alterante proof of the Alon-Seymour-Thomas theorem that every excluded-minor family of graphs has \(O(\sqrt{n})\)-node balanced separators.

Naor (FOCS'06) [credit: Patrick Massot] We prove that the function \(d : \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to [0,\infty)\) given by \begin{align*} d(&(x,y,z),(t,u,v)) \\ &= \left(\left[\left((t-x)^2+(u-y)^2\right)^2 + (v-z+2xu-2yt)^2\right]^{1/2} + (t-x)^2 + (u-y)^2\right)^{1/2} \end{align*} is a metric on \(\mathbb{R}^3\) such that \((\mathbb{R}^3, \sqrt{d})\) is isometric to a subset of Hilbert space, yet \((\mathbb{R}^3,d)\) does not admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into \(L_1\). This yields a new simple counter example to the Goemans-Linial conjecture on the integrality gap of the SDP relaxation of the Sparsest Cut problem. Our methods involve Fourier analytic techniques, combined with a breakthrough of Cheeger and Kleiner , along with classical results of Pansu on the differentiability of Lispchitz functions on the Heisenberg group. @inproceedings{LN06, author = {James R.

Our results allow yield algorithms for constructing approximately optimal tree decompositions of graphs. If a graph has treewidth \(k\), we find a tree decomposition of width at most \(O(k \sqrt{\log k})\). If, additionally, the input graph excludes a fixed graph as a minor, we produce a tree decomposition of width \(O(k)\).
