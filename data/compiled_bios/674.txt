 Chris Peikert Chris Peikert Ph.D. (MIT), 2006 Associate Professor (Patrick C. Fischer Development Professor) Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) Email: cpeikert [at] umich [dot] edu, Twitter: @ChrisPeikert Office: Beyster 3601 Phone: 734 . 936 . 2974 Jump to: news teaching talks research. In 2006 I received my Ph.D. from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. My advisor was the incomparable Silvio Micali. My research interests include cryptography, lattices, coding theory, algorithms, and computational complexity. A particular focus is on cryptographic schemes whose security can be based on the apparent intractability of lattice problems. Further information may be found in my research summary. Postdoc available: I am seeking a postdoc, preferably (but not exclusively) one working in lattice crypto or closely related areas. Please email me if you are interested!
