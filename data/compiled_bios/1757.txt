 Prof. Denis Thrien's Home Page / McConnell Engineering Building, Rm. 318 3480 University Street Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2A7 denis@cs.mcgill.ca (514) 398-7073 FAX: (514) 398-3883 RESEARCH My favorite area of research is complexity theory, i.e., trying to classify problems in terms of resources required to compute their solution. This obviously is a very fundamental question for computer scientists. I have done extensive work on developing algebraic characterizations for complexity classes, but I also am a fan of logical tools, combinatorics, probabilistic methods and mathematics in general.
