Many of the answers are already there. See the Spring 2019 orientation notes for more information, and to figure out who is your advisor! I cannot help with issues related to admissions, finances or student visas. Please contact the appropriate office for these matters. I do not waive prerequisites for courses without the consent of the instructor. (This is because I do not claim to know which specific background material is required for each class.) If you think that you have covered all the prerequisites for a class, please email the instructor or bring a completed change of enrollment form to class for him or her to sign. These forms are available here along with other useful forms and the schedule of classes. Please send me an email with your questions before stopping by my office. If I can't answer via email, we'll arrange an appointment. Email is preferred instead of telephone for record-keeping and other purposes. Iraklis Tsekourakis 2019
