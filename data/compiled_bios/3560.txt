Andrew R. Neureuther: Contact Information 511 Cory Hall tel: 510-642-4590 neureuth@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Integrated Circuits (INC) Solid-State Devices . Research Centers Integrated Modeling Process and Computation for Technology (IMPACT) . . Biography He received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1963, 1964 and 1966, respectively, as a member of the Antenna Laboratory. Dr. Neureuther joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley as a faculty member in 1966 where he is the Conexant Systems Distinguished Professor. Dr. Neureuther has pioneered modeling and simulation of integrated circuit processing for many physical process effects as well as the use of these tools to explore innovation and manufacturing issues in emerging technologies. His work includes models for chemically amplified imaging materials (STORM); simulation of optical, electron, ion beam and x-ray lithography (SAMPLE); assessment of residual effects of defects and lens aberrations (SPLAT); electromagnetic scattering (TEMPEST); time-evolution of topography (SAMPLE3D); environments for integrating simulators with process flow (SIMPL); and remote web-based simulation (LAVA). Dr. Neureuther is a Fellow of the IEEE. He has published 250 papers and has advised 35 M.S. and 30 Ph.D. students. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (1995). He received the IEEE 2003 Cledo Brunetti field award which is given for contributions to miniaturization in electronics. He was awarded the Berkeley Citation in 2007. In 2011, he won the Frits Zernike Award for Microlithography. .
