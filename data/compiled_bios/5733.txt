RESEARCH Ram's research vision is to create a "robust Internet" by understanding the Internet's structure and behavior through principled measurements. To that end, Ram is developing techniques for (i) measuring and analyzing the topological structure of the Internet, (ii) measuring and understanding end-to-end path dynamics, and (iii) designing scalable and deployable systems to mitigate risks, outages, and cybersecurity issues. Broadly speaking, Ram has addressed research questions in several areas of computer networking including network measurements and analysis, network economics, large-scale network simulations, debugging and testing in software-defined networks, mobile and wireless communication, Internet of things, visualization, cyber attacks and security issues, and datacenter transport protocols.
