I am especially interested in studying how future technology trends influence the design of microprocessors and memory systems. In recent years, we have focused on designing memory systems that can cater to the bandwidth, latency, power, cost, security, and reliability demands of datacenter and big-data workloads. We are also exploring neuromorphic architectures. Current projects include: Neuromorphic Architectures : designing accelerators and biology-inspired architectures for cognitive or machine-learning applications. Memory Systems : optimizing DRAM/NVM chips, memory controllers, data placement, and security for big-data and datacenter workloads. Past projects include: Reliability : efficient mechanisms to support chipkill reliability in the memory system. Large cache design : methodologies to model large NUCA cache hierarchies, policies to organize data, and organizations in 3D. Interconnect design : leveraging different wires in a heterogeneous network for architectural innovation. Transactional memory : innovations for scalable hardware transactional memory.
