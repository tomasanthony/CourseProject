Pilling (Building 14) office hours: M: 10-11am, W: 10-11am, R: 1-3pm, F: 10-11am Teaching Schedule CSC 430 - Programming Languages I Research Interests My interests span much of computer science, but I (try to) focus my attention on the study of programming languages. I am interested in improving the tools that programmers rely on. To that end, I study the implementation and theory of programming languages, recently with particular focus on program analysis. I previously worked on concurrent programming languages (such as JR ). Publications Earthworm: Automated Decomposition Suggestions N. Garg and A. W.
