 Tianzheng Wang Assistant Professor School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University Office: TASC1 9213 Phone: 778-782-4488 Email: tzwang@sfu.ca I am an assistant professor in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University (since August 2018). Previously, I was a research engineer at Huawei Canada Research Centre in Toronto. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Toronto in 2017 . At Toronto, my advisors were Ryan Johnson and Angela Demke Brown . I received my B.Sc. in Computing degree from Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2012. Hiring: I am looking for highly motivated students (undergraduate, masters and PhD) interested in the systems side of databases and related topics in computer systems (e.g., OS, networking, file systems). If you would like to work with me, please email me with your resume and transcripts. Research Interests I am broadly interested in computer systems, especially exploiting modern hardware (e.g., new memory/storage media, massively parallel processors, fast network) to build fast and energy-efficient systems, both large (server) and small (embedded). My current focus is on data-intensive systems and related areas that impact the design of database systems, such as parallel programming, distributed systems and operating systems. I also have interests in embedded and mobile systems. Recent Papers ( see here for older ones ) Easy Lock-Free Programming in Non-Volatile Memory.
