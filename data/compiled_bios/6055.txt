 Dan Dougherty Professor of Computer Science Worcester Polytechnic Institute 1 Research Publications WPI's Applied Logic and Security (ALAS) lab 2 Teaching B term 2017: CS 4123, Theory of Computation C term 2018: CS 4536, Programming Languages Spring Semester 2018: CS 503, Foundations of Computer Science Perhaps you are wondering about the difference between CS 503 and CS 5003? 3 Ombuds I serve as Ombudsman for the university, together with my colleague Liz Tomaszewsi. 4 Visiting Here are directions to WPI and a map of campus . I am in room 231 of Fuller Labs: this is building number 11 on the map. Parking is competetitive. To park on campus legally one needs to secure a visitor's parking sticker, which guarantees you nothing; during low-traffic times the best place to park is in the lot behind Fuller Labs (on the west side of Boylston St); another possibility is the lot labelled "Staff parking", near the intersection of Park Ave and Salisbury St (on the west side of John Wing Road). 5 Coordinates Daniel J.
