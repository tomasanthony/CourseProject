 Varun Shankar Assistant Professor Lecturer School of Computing University of Utah Home Research CV Teaching MEB 3112 School of Computing University of Utah Salt Lake City, UT 84112 shankar AT cs.utah.edu I currently hold a long-term Assistant Professor Lecturer position in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. My primary teaching responsibilities involve devloping curriculum materials for the Master's in Software Development (MSD) program in the School of Computing. I also teach classes both within and outside the MSD program. My primary research focus is the use of Radial Basis Function interpolation to generate meshfree methods for the solution of PDEs on surfaces and irregular domains. I am also interested in research at the intersection of approximation theory, machine learning, and numerical methods. I am also very familiar with different parallel programming paradigms, and frequently use them in my research. I obtained my PhD in Computing (with a focus on Scientific Computing) from the School of Computing at the University of Utah under Professor Robert M. Kirby. I was co-advised by Professor Aaron Fogelson , and mentored by Professor Grady Wright .
