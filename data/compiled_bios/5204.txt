 Omer Tamuz I am an assistant professor of economics and mathematics at Caltech. My research is in microeconomic theory , including game theory , learning and information , as well as in probability , ergodic theory and group theory . I'm also interested in machine learning and statistics . I am a member of the Caltech SISL and DOLCIT interdisciplinary research groups. Short Bio I got my B.Sc. in computer science and physics from Tel Aviv University, where I participated in the search for extrasolar planets with the brilliant Tsevi Mazeh . In 2013 I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from the Weizmann Institute, advised by Elchanan Mossel . From 2013 until 2015 I was a Schramm postdoctoral fellow at the MIT math department / Microsoft Research, where I previously was an intern of Adam Kalai . I have been at Caltech since 2015. Write to my gmail (omertamuz), or visit me in Baxter , room 213. Workshops This summer we hosted the Workshop on Information and Social Economics (WISE). This was the second instance of the workshop we had two years ago . This winter we held the The Southern California Symposium on Network Economics and Game Theory (NEGT) here at Caltech.
