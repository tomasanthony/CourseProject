This concept is being pursued further : a small Principal's e-Learning Fund project has developed an interface for student communities to re-use video recordings of tutorials as a learning resource. A prototype of this system (which we call "YouTute") is being put into use with several courses in Informatics. This work has been recognised by the Chancellor's Award for Teaching 2009 . My other activities centre around several themes: the relationship between language and other modalities information technology in support of design and learning communication, information management and knowledge representation in urban and similar contexts -- as part of the COST Action C21 (Towntology) (which has recently concluded). I maintain an international bibliography of works by, and book-length works devoted to, the late philosopher of language and many other things, Nelson Goodman .
