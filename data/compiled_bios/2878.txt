Dr. Oscar Morales Ponce joined the Department of Engineering and Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2015. Dr. Ponce obtained his Ph.D in Computer Science from Carleton University in 2011. He was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Chalmers University of Technology from 2012 to 2014 and at Carleton University from 2011 to 2012. He was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Information Science and Technology St. Paul the Apostle from February to July 2015. Ponce also has several years' experience in the private sector as a software engineer and IT consultant. Dr. Ponce's research focuses on the design and analysis of cooperative algorithms to self-coordinate the actions of distributed systems that can communicate directly by message passing or indirectly by observing the behavior of other participants. He has applied his research to cyber-physical systems for an EU-funded project, where cooperative vehicles self-coordinate their actions in timely critical maneuvers to maintain high safety standards. His research interests include theoretical and practical aspects of distributed computing, wireless sensor networks, distributed control of robotic networks, computational geometry, graph theory, vehicular networks and intelligent transportation systems.
