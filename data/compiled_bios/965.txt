 Suzanne Stevenson Brief Bio Publications Students Teaching Dept. of Computer Science University of Toronto Suzanne Stevenson Professor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4, CANADA email : suzanne [at] cs [dot] toronto [dot] edu phone : 416-978-6277 fax : 416-978-1455 office : Pratt Building, Room 283C 6 King's College Road My research is in computational linguistics and cognitive science. I take a highly multidisciplinary approach integrating computational theories and techniques with insights from the fields of linguistics and psycholinguistics. My work in CL often focuses on machine learning of semantic and syntactic information from text data, showing how linguistic knowledge or cognitive principles can help guide the learning process. In cognitive science, I work on computational models of child language acquisition as well as adult processing, taking probabilistic approaches that learn from and adapt to the environment. I'm always interested in prospective graduate students who are fascinated by human language, keen to learn more about how people learn and process language, and excited about the possibilities for bringing these interests together within a computational approach to language.
