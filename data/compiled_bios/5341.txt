 Autonomous Agents Research Group Home Group Publications Contact About The Autonomous Agents Research Group is a research unit within the Centre for Intelligent Systems and their Applications in the School of Informatics , University of Edinburgh . Research in the group is centred on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies toward the realisation of intelligent agents (such as software agents and robots) that can act autonomously to solve problems in complex dynamic environments. The group has a strong focus on problems of coordination and cooperation in multi-agent systems, in which multiple autonomous agents interact in a shared environment. Current research focuses on inference and planning in dynamic multi-agent systems and algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning . The group also has experience in the development of autonomous agents applications, including in the areas of autonomous vehicles (working with FiveAI ) and cyber security.
