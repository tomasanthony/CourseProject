My undergraduate degree (BMath, co-op) came from the University of Waterloo ( Alumni News ). My former employers are: (a) Westech Information Systems (a spin-off of BC Hydro; afterwards, Westech became part of BC Hydro again, and then it was privatized in 2003, so that computing services are now provided under contract by Accenture); (b) Amoco Canada Petroleum (formerly Dome Petroleum, formerly Hudson's Bay Oil & Gas; Amoco is now part of BP) where I worked from 1979-1989 including my co-op days. I also worked at the Centre for Advanced Studies in IBM's Toronto Laboratory, and at UBC as a Sessional Lecturer. I'm a tenured Senior Instructor, Computer Science Advisor, Undergraduate Operations Committee member, and I help with the Curriculum Committee. My teaching portfolio includes database systems, data structures, discrete mathematics, engineering computation and design (in C), object-oriented programming (in C++), English (i.e., scientific (evidence-based) argumentation and writing, with peer review), and Data Science topics in Privacy, Ethics, and Security. Fields of Interest: Computer Science Education (e.g., Best Practices in Teaching & Learning) Database Systems Outliers (my PhD thesis was entitled "Outliers and Data Mining") Data Mining Biblical Eschatology and Apologetics
