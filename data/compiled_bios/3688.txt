 Ronald D. Schrimpf Professor of Electrical Engineering Vanderbilt University Box 1608, Station B Nashville, TN 37235 Ron Schrimpf is a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Vanderbilt University , where his research activities focus on microelectronics and semiconductor devices. In particular, he has a very active research program dealing with the effects of radiation on semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. The Radiation Effects and Reliability Group at Vanderbilt is the largest of its type at any US University. Current projects include application and development of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) tools for radiation effects, use of high performance parallel computing to simulate single-event effects and soft errors in integrated circuits, atomic-scale modeling of radiation-induced defects, very low dose-rate (spacelike) effects on bipolar and MOS integrated circuits, total-dose and single-event effects in power devices and circuits, and development of radiation-effects and hardness-assurance test methodologies. Ron is the Director of the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics (ISDE). The engineering staff of ISDE performs design, analysis, and modeling work for a variety of space- and defense-oriented organizations. He received his BEE, MSEE, and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Minnesota in 1981, 1984, and 1986, respectively. He joined the University of Arizona in 1986, where he served as a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He joined Vanderbilt in 1996 and was an Invited Professor at the University of Montpellier II, France, in 2000 Contact Information ron.schrimpf@vanderbilt.edu Phone: (615) 343-0507 Fax: (615) 343-0601 Honors and Awards Chancellor's Award for Research, Vanderbilt University, 2003.
