 Aditya Bhaskara Home Research Teaching I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah . I am also a member of the data group here at the university. The best way to reach me is by email: bhaskaraaditya AT gmail DOT com . I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. I am interested in understanding when learning problems are tractable, and in designing provably efficient algorithms. Recently, I have been interested in robustness in algorithm design, specifically for problems like low rank approximation, regression, and the like. See my research page for details. For students. Much of my research involves linear algebra, probability, and ideas from 'classical' approximation algorithms. If you have strong background in these areas and are interested in working with me, please send me email. (Fall 2018) I will be teaching Graduate Algorithms. Here is the course homepage . I will also be running (with Suresh ) a seminar on Reading theory . Recent/upcoming program committees: SODA 2019, WWW 2018, KDD 2017, FOCS 2017.
