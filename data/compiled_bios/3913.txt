Dmitry Berenson Dmitry Berenson Assistant Professor Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept. College of Engineering University of Michigan Office: 3217 EECS Office Phone: 734-764-4377 Email: berenson [at] eecs.umich.edu Home Research Publications Software Outreach About Me I received a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2005, where I started my robotics work in Hod Lipson's lab . I went on to graduate from the Ph.D. program at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2011, where my advisors were Siddhartha Srinivasa and James Kuffner . While at CMU, I worked in the Personal Robotics Lab and completed interships at the Digital Human Research Center in Japan, Intel Labs in Pittsburgh, and LAAS-CNRS in France. In 2012 I completed a post-doc at UC Berkeley working with Ken Goldberg and Pieter Abbeel . I was an Assistant Professor at WPI 2012-2016. I started as an Assistant Professor in the EECS Department at the University of Michigan in 2016. I am also a member of the Michigan Robotics Institute . My current research focuses on motion planning and manipulation. I have received the IEEE RAS Early Career Award and the NSF CAREER award. Research Focus My research focuses on creating algorithms that allow robots to interact with the world and collaborate efficiently with people. These general-purpose motion planning and manipulation algorithms can be applied to robots that work in homes, factories, and operating rooms. I am interested in all aspects of algorithm development; including creating efficient algorithms, proving their theoretical properties, validating them on real-world robots and problems, integrating them with sensing and higher-level reasoning, and distributing them to open-source communities. I draw on ideas in search, optimization, control theory, and topology to develop these planning algorithms and to prove their properties. I also seek to develop algorithms which can generalize to many types of practical tasks and application areas. See the ARM Lab website for current projects and publications.
