 Dr. Adam J. Lee joined the Department of Computer Science in the fall of 2008. He received the MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005 and 2008, respectively. Prior to that, he received his BS in Computer Science from Cornell University. Dr. Lee's research interests lie at the intersection of the computer security, privacy, and distributed systems fields. He is particularly interested in trust negotiation and distributed proof construction approaches to authorization, which can be used to facilitate secure interactions across multiple security domains while still preserving each individuals privacy and autonomy.Dr. Lee's research has been supported by the NSF and DARPA, and he is an NSF CAREER award recipient (2012).
