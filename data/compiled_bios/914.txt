Nicholas Mattei is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Tulane University. His research focuses on the theory and practice of artificial intelligence; largely motivated by problems that require a blend of techniques to develop systems and algorithms that support decision making for autonomous agents and/or humans. Most of his projects and leverage theory, data, and experiment to create novel algorithms, mechanisms, and systems that enable and support individual and group decision making.
