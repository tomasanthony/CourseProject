We are developing new specification mining techniques to automatically identify the properties of a hardware design that are critical to security, and we are building Coppelia , a tool for the symbolic execution of a hardware design that enables bug finding, exploit generation, assertion refinement, or patch verification. VeHICaL My team also participates in the multi-institution project VeHICaL: Verified Human Interfaces, Control, and Learning for Semi-Autonomous Systems . Our focus is on the security and privacy concerns surrounding cyber-physical systems that interact continuously with people. We have released the Drowsy Driving Dataset , which provides video of users in a simulated driving scenario alongside their reported drowsiness levels.
