Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo! Research. My thesis was awarded the 2009 SIGMOD Jim Gray Dissertation Award, Honorable Mention. Curriculum Vitae and full bio . Students & Postdocs: Yan Chen Xi He Ios Kotsogiannis Nisarg Raval Maryam Fanaeepour (postdoc) Alumni: Ben Stoddard (MS) (--> Google) Kiron Lebeck (BS) (--> PhD candidate at U Washington) Bharat Chelapalli (MS) (--> Amazon) Prospective Students: I am primarily interested statistical privacy , or the problem of disclosing aggregate statistics about data collected from individuals, while ensuring that individuals level sensitive properties are not disclosed. This problem appears in a number of diverse application settings including in the US Census, social networks, search logs, location tracking, etc. Read one of the following articles to get an idea of my research: ( ACM Crossroads article , no free lunch in privacy , CACM article , Blowfish privacy ). I am also interested in privacy of visual secrets in augmented reality systems -- an evergrowing threat due to the popularity of camera driven devices like smart phones and Google Glasses. Read this paper for an overview of our research.
