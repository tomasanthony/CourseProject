Arthur G. Werschulz I am a Professor of Computer Science in the Computer and Information Sciences Department of Fordham University . In addition, I am an Adjunct Senior Research Scientist in the Columbia University Computer Science Department . I am teaching the following courses during the Spring, 2019 semester: CISC 4090 (Theory of Computation) CISC 5200 (Computer Language Theory) Please consult my schedule if you want to find me. My research area is information-based complexity, studying the inherent difficulty of problems for which the information is partial, possibly noisy, and priced. We are especially interested in the tractability of high-dimensional problems. My particular expertise is in the following: Function approximation. Partial differential equations. Integral equations. Ill-posed problems. Some of my more recent publications are available online . I am also the coauthor (with J. F. Traub ) of Complexity and Information , published by Cambridge University Press as part of the series Lezioni Lincee , Academia Nazionale dei Lincei. My Erds number is four, via any of the following paths: A. G. Werschulz, J. F. Traub, J. B. Kruskal, A. J. Hoffman, P. Erds A. G. Werschulz, J. F. Traub, W. S. Brown, R. L. Graham, P. Erds A. G.
