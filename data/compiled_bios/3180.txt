Supervisor: Professor Deena Engel, Courant Institute of Mathematics. MoMA Liaison: Glenn Wharton, Media Conservator, Museum of Modern Art. Students worked on a research project preparing documentation on a work of computational art in order to facilitate conservation decisions about this work in particular and to provide a model for this process for such works in general. The documentation included an overview of the technologies used, a flowchart of the work, identification and narrative descriptions of the functions and procedures and an overview to contextualize the work within the field of current computational art.
