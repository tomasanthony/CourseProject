If you need a good architecture simulator, take a look at SESC , a very fast multiprocessor simulator. And here is a good way of choosing your next architecture or compiler conference. We have released our Grappa runtime system for large-scale irregular applications (e.g., graph analytics), take a look! We have also recently started publicizing approxbench.org , and ACCEPT , a set of tools and benchmarks for approximate computing research. Take a look at the collectively written white-paper on 21st Century computer architecture research. I am lucky to have my research supported by Microsoft, Intel, Google, Qualcomm, NetApp, NSF, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. I am also a member of the Center for Future Architectures Research . I received an NSF CAREER Award and a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship to develop ideas on deterministic multiprocessing and multicore programmability in general. I am also the 2013 recipient of the IEEE TCCA Young Computer Architect Award.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . I got my BEng and MEng in Electrical Engineering from University of So Paulo , Brazil. Self portraits. I love to cook and eat . I am very fortunate to have such a happy family . My (much smarter than me) brother was freezing in Michigan but having fun with aerospace engineering, now he is in sunny California at NASA AMES.. I am always happy because she exists.
