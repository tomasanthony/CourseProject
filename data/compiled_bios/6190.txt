Education BS, Hanoi University of Science and Technology MS, New York University PhD, New York University Biography I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from New York University, and my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I am was a postdoc in the University of Montral. I was a recipient the IBM Ph.D. fellowship in 2016. Research Interests My research explores mechanisms to understand human languages for computers so that computers can perform cognitive language-related tasks for us. Among others, I am especially interested in distilling structured information and mining useful knowledge from the massive human-written text of various domains. Toward this end, our lab employs and designs effective learning algorithms for information extraction and text mining in natural language processing and data mining. We are currently focusing on deep learning algorithms to solve such problems. We are among the first groups that develop deep learning models and demonstrate their effectiveness for information extraction. We are also targeting other language-related problems with deep learning, including reading comprehension, machine translation, natural language generation, and chatbots..
