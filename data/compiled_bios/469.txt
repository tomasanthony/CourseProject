This creates a great\r burden on programmers who must be experts in both their application\r domain and in the myriad system issues that affect power, energy,\r reliability, performance, and more. To alleviate this burden, I study\r ways to build  self-aware computing systems  that understand\r high-level goals and automatically adapt their behavior to meet those\r goals optimally. This is interdisciplinary work covering traditional\r areas, like operating systems and computer architecture, as well as\r new areas, like control theory and machine learning applied to\r computer system management and optimization.\r \r \r Project Web Pages:  CERES , SEEC, POET, LEO\r \r Current Students: \r Saeid Barati, \r G\xf6kalp Demirci,\r Bernard Dickens,\r Anne Farrel,\r Will Kong,\r Ivana Marincic,\r Ahsan Pervaiz,\r Muhammad Husni Santriaji,\r Yuliana Zamora,\r  Huazhe (Harper) Zhang \r \r Alumni:\r Zhixuan Zhou, PhD 2018 [thesis] , Google \r Connor Imes, PhD, 2018 [thesis] , ISI East \r Nikita Mishra, PhD 2017  [thesis], Solvvy \r Lee Ehudin, BS/MS 2017, Google \r Tristan Rasmussen, BS/MS 2015, Google\r \r \r Old Research Statement (from 2015): [pdf] \r \r \r \r \r \r \r News\r \r  Our CALOREE paper from ASPLOS 2018 was selected as an IEEE Micro Top Picks Honorable Mention.  Here is the summary we submitted:  [pdf]. \r  I got a great introduction to quantum computing from  Fred Chong  and the   EPICQ  project at UChicago.  Our collaboration creating an optimizing quantum compiler (with up to 10x reductions in program latency!) will appear at ASPLOS 2019.\r  I had a great time representing our department at the Grace Hopper Celebration 2018.   [article]  \r  We recently published two papers with exponential improvements on the worst case approximation for scheduling under performance and power constraints.  The first (at STACS 2018) improved the known bound from O(n) to O(log n). The second (at Supercomputing 2018) made this algorithm practical by accounting for configurable power/performance tradeoffs. To the best of our knowledge these are the first practical scheduling algorithms that use something other than greedy approaches. \r   Bernard Dickens III has received a Generation Google Scholarship.  Congrats Bernard!\r   Efforts to commercialize my self-aware computing research were described in a recent Crunchbase article. \r  I was granted early tenure by the University of Chicago (effective 07/01/2018). \r Paper on hardware support for real-time GPU computing accepted to RTAS.\r  We got three papers into ASPLOS 2018!\r     \r         CALOREE, combining learning and control for intelligent resource management.\r         SmartConf, automatically adjusting performance-sensitive configurations in web-infrastructure software.\r          StrongBox, using mobile hardware and stream ciphers for secure file systems with much higher performance than AES-XTS.\r     \r  I am honored to serve as the program chair of WAX 2018, co-located with ASPLOS.\r  I have graduated my first PhD student, Nikita Mishra.
