 Research Publications and Media People Group Photos News Sponsors Contact Useful Info Group Members Only Our group is composed of people interested and enthusiastic about light, photons, optical devices and systems. We pursue new research discoveries in the broad fields of nanophotonics and biophotonics. Below are some of the research projects we have previously or are currently working on. For detailed descriptions about each project, please visit our publication page . At our spare time, we enjoy turning our research into fun stuff. For example, the logo on the uppper-left corner is the red fluorescence of CdSe QDs patterned using a self-assembly fabrication process.
