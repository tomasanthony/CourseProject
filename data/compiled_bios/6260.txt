Glenn Gulak, Ph.D., P.Eng. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Toronto Home Publications Graduate Students Courses Presentations Bio Contact Research Highlights Going the distance with future-proof quantum cryptography Quantum computing will bring a whole new set of security concerns to the internet but recent advancements in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) are providing solutions to these emerging challenges. Glenn Gulak recognized with RBC Research Prize Professor Glenn Gulak of The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) is one of four University of Toronto researchers recognized with an RBC Research Prize at the launch of the new RBC Research Institute, a collaboration with U of T. SHIELD: Scalable Homomorphic Implementation of Encrypted Data-Classifiers In this work, we describe an optimized Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) based implementation of a variant of the HE system recently proposed by Gentry, Sahai and Waters (GSW). SecureMed: Secure Medical Computation Using GPU-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Scheme Sharing the medical records of individuals among healthcare providers and researchers around the world can accelerate advances in medical research. High-Throughput 0.13-m CMOS Lattice Reduction Core Supporting 880 Mb/s Detection This paper presents the first silicon-proven implementation of a lattice reduction (LR) algorithm, which achieves maximum likelihood diversity. A Low-Latency Low-Power QR-Decomposition ASIC Implementation in 0.13 m CMOS This paper presents a hybrid QR decomposition (QRD) design that reduces the number of computations and increases their execution parallelism by using a unique combination of Multi-dimensional Givens rotations, Householder transformations and conventional 2-D Givens rotations. 2018 UofT.
