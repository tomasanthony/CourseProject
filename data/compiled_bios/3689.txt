 Jerry Spinrad Associate Professor of Computer Science Vanderbilt University Nashville, TN 37235, USA My research interests are in the area of graph algorithms. I am particularly interested in recognition algorithms for classes of graphs with interesting representations. Examples of classes of graphs I work with include permutation graphs, comparability graphs, circular-arc graphs, circle graphs, trapezoid graphs, and two dimensional partial orders. If you are interested in this type of research, you might look at some web files which I will try to get started here . I received a BS in Computer Science from Yale University and a PhD in Computer Science from princeton University in 1978 and 1982 respectively. You will find a list of my journal publications here .
