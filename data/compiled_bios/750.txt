Previously, I was a postdoc in the Computational Complexity group chaired by Prof. Dr. Markus Blser at MaxPlanckInstituteforComputerScience and Saarland University , Saarbrcken, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D in Theoretical Computer Science from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai , where I was very fortunate to have Prof. Meena Mahajan as my advisor. Internships: I am not taking any interns the coming summer. However, check the Dept Internships page for updates.
