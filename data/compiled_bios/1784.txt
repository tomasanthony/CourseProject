In the Visualization Design Lab we create visualization systems that support exploratory, complex data analysis tasks. These systems allow researchers and scholars to validate their computational models, to understand their underlying data in detail, and to develop new hypotheses and insights. We take a problem-driven approach to research, relying on both a detailed understanding of the needs of, and a close collaboration with, domain experts to guide the design of algorithms, visual encodings, and interaction mechanisms. Our visualization systems build upon principles and methodologies from perception, design, and human-computer interaction, and our reflection on building these systems leads to insights about people's relationship with data.
