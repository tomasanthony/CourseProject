I'm interested in both theory and practicewith particular interests in side-channel attacks, hardware security, cryptanalysis, secure multiparty computation (MPC), verifiable computation and SNARKS. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University Of Michigan. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University ofPennsylvaniaand the University of Maryland, where I was hosted by Prof. Nadia Heninger and Prof. Jonathan Katz.Previously I have been a Ph.D student at the Computer Science Department in the Technion Israel's Institute of Technology where I was co-advised by Prof. Yuval Ishai and Prof. Eran Tromer. I am looking for excellent students interested in working on topics related to security and cryptography DBLP Google Scholar Teaching EECS 589-12: Topics in Hardware Security (Fall 2018) Publications Jo Van Bulck, Marina Minkin, Ofir Weisse, Daniel Genkin, Baris Kasikci, Frank Piessens, Mark Silberstein, Thomas F.
