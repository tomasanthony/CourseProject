 Brigitte Pientka Home Research Teaching About Short About Brigitte Pientka is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University , and leading the Computation and Logic group. She received her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, and studied previously at the University of Edinburgh and Technical University of Darmstadt. Sidebar Menu Home Research Interests Recent Publications Professional Activities Research Interests My research interest lies in developing a theoretical and practical foundation for building and reasoning about reliable safe software systems. To achieve this goal, I combine theoretical research on the logical foundations of computer science in programming languages and verification with system building. The topics I am interested in include logics (classical and non-classical), type theory, theorem proving, logic and functional programming, and logical frameworks. For more information, you can visit Computation and Logic group.
