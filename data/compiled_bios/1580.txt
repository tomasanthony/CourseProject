 Susan Rodger's Home Page I'm a Professor of the Practice in the Computer Science Department at Duke University . I received my BS in computer science and mathematics from N.C. State University in 1983, the year the cinderella basketball team won the NCAA Championship. I received my MS and Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue University in 1985 and 1989. Purdue CS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. From 1989 until 1994, I was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
