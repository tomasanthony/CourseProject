Prior to joining WSU, I was a tenure-track assistant professor at SIU Carbondale (2016-2018). I completed my Ph.D. dissertation work at University of Alabama in 2015 under the supervision of Professor Jeffrey Carver and conducted postdoctoral research under the guidance of Dr. Danfeng Yao at Virginia Tech. My general research interests lie in the area of software engineering. My research spans peer code review, software security, android security, blockchain software development, malware detection, cybersecurity, mining software repositories, empirical software engineering, and social network analysis. Announcement: I am looking for hard-working and self-motivated Ph.D. students to work on Software Engineering areas. If you are interested, please email me your resume and test scores. I will consider only the students with decent credentials (e.g., GPA > 3.25 on the scale of 4.00 and GRE Quantitative score > 162).
