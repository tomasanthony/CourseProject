Kevin Gary Associate Professor Kevin Gary joined ASU in 2004 after working in industry and a prior appointment on the faculty of the Catholic University of America. He serves on the program faculty for the undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Software Engineering at ASU. His research interests are in software architecture, agile methods, and open source. He particularly focuses on applications in healthcare and e-learning. In healthcare, he recently spent a year on sabbatical as the Chief Architect in the Sheik Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at the Childrens National Medical Center in Washington D.C., working on projects in image-guided and robotic surgery, and mobile applications for healthcare (mHealth). In teaching innovation, he created the Software Enterprise, an experiential learning model which blends multiple methods of delivery into one pedagogical model. The Software Enterprise forms the core project spine within the B.S. and M.S. degree programs in Software Engineering at ASU, and in 2011 he was part of team to receive the Presidents Award for Innovation from Dr. Crow. He is engaged in service to the profession and to ASU, reviewing for several established journals, serving on conference program committees, and spending a year as the Associate Chair of computing programs on the Polytechnic Campus. He is a member of IEEE, ACM, and ASEE. kgary@asu.edu 480-727-1373 Peralta 230C Education Ph.D. Computer Science, Arizona State University 1999 M.S.
