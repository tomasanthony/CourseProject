We look into various approaches in which these devices can leverage the available sensing, computation and communication capabilities to design collaborative applications.

Sensor Network Protocols There is a strong emphasis on system implementation in this work. Most of the proposed protocols have been implemented in TinyOS and evaluated on testbeds consisting of MICA2, MICAz and/or TelsoB motes. We have gone through 3 generations of sensor testbeds and the third generation deployment is INDRIYA, a 140 nodes sensor testbed .

Indriya Sensor Network testbed DTN Applications We look at how DTN routing protocol can benefit from application semantics. A simple motivation example is that it is much better that 50% of the files are completely received than receiving 50% of all the files - resulting in no successful file downloads at all. We propose an application aware routing protocol that can exploit application semantics expressed through a graph structure. Results show improvement of more than 500% in some scenarios. This work is partially funded by the SMART Future Urban Mobility IRG.

Energy Efficient Protocol As the current generation of mobile smartphones become more powerful, they are being used to perform more resource intensive tasks. Our measurements show that the display and network resources each consuming close to 45% of the total battery power when fully operational. Hence, we focus on saving energy on both the display and network interface.
