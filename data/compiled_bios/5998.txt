University of British Columbia (2002); M.Sc., University of British Columbia (2004); Ph.D., University of Calgary (2008); Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Washington (2008-2010); Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo (2010-2015); Associate Professor, University of British Columbia (2015-current). Research Software is a human product; as systems scale in size and complexity, the challenges that developers must overcome rapidly increase. I believe that by better understanding how people create, explore, evolve, and reason about software systems, we can enhance developers' effectiveness and improve the quality of their systems. My past projects have investigated a range of problems surrounding software reuse, software search, context-sensitive example location, API understanding, and team awareness. I am currently focusing on software testing, inconsistency detection and speculative analysis.
