VRTO2016, Virtual and Augmented Reality 2016 Steve Mann was recognized as "The Father of The Wearable Computer", IEEE ISSCC, Feb. 7th, 2000. "Steve Mann is the perfect example of someone... who persisted in his vision and ended up founding a new discipline." -- -- Nicholas Negroponte, Founder, Director, and Chairman, MIT Media Lab Mann is full professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Toronto, and is the Chief Scientist of the Rotman School of Management's CD Lab. He is also the Chief Scietist of Meta (http://spaceglasses.com), recently closing a $23 million Series A funding round .
