I am particularly interested in features and learning-based methods that apply to both vision and language, thus breaking away from the persistent compartmentalization of recognition tasks (something hinted at by David Marr over 30 years ago). This has led to some interesting, and often unconventional approaches that can be applied to a broad set of areas including computer vision, machine learning, human biometrics, and the digital humanities. Specifically, my work is looking at open set recognition, extreme value theory models for visual recognition, biologically-inspired learning algorithms, and stylometry. Summary of Activities/Interests: Primary interests in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Biometrics,and Digital Humanities. Specific areas of research include Open Set Recognition, Extreme Value Theory Models for Visual Recognition, Biologically-inspired Learning Algorithms, and Stylometry.
