More news Welcome I am looking for PhD students and postdocs with interests and expertise in embedded systems, formal methods, control theory, and cyber-physical systems! I am Nortel Networks Assistant Professor in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and the director of the Cyber-Physical Systems Lab (CPSL) at Duke University . My research interests focus on design and analysis of cyber-physical systems and in particular, embedded and distributed/networked control, real-time and embedded systems, and high-confidence medical devices and systems. Before joining Duke, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the PRECISE Center , University of Pennsylvania. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012. I also received Dipl. Ing. (5 years) and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Belgrade in 2003 and 2007, and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UPenn in 2010. Prior to PhD studies at UPenn, I was a research associate and lecturer at the School of Electrical Engineering , University of Belgrade. I have received various awards including ONR Young Investigator Award NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award Nortel Networks Professorship, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University ACM SIGBED/SIGSOFT Frank Anger Memorial Award EMSOFT'17 Best Paper Award ICCPS'14 Best Paper Award RTAS'12 Best Student Paper Award IBM Faculty Award, 2018 Joseph and Rosaline Wolf Best Dissertation Award from Penn Engineering Honeywell User Group Wireless Innovation Award More 2013 Miroslav Pajic Template design by Andreas Viklund
