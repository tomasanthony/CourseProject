 Welcome to the Shehu Laboratory Home Publications Research Tools Funding Teaching Service Members Meetings Research in the Shehu Lab Our laboratory focuses on developing novel algorithms to bridge between computer science, engineering, and the life sciences. Our research emphasis is on problem solving, search, optimization, planning, and machine learning to simulate, analyze, and characterize complex dynamic systems operating in the presence of constraints . Our application domains are diverse, spanning from bioinformatics and computational biology, to human-computer interaction and computer-aided engineering design.
