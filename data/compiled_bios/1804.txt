 Michael D. Adams I am a Research Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Utah and currently run the U Combinator lab . My research area is programming languages with an emphasis on static analysis/control-flow analysis, syntax and parsing, compilers and optimization, and next-generation languages. My research objectives relate to the design, implementation and construction of programming languages, compilers and software analysis tools that help programmers more easily implement, reason about, prove correct and improve the performance of their programs. I graduated from Indiana University under the supervision of R. Kent Dybvig and did post-doctoral research on: the High-Assurance Systems Programming (HASP) project with Mark Jones , Jim Hook and Andrew Tolmach at Portland State University, the K Framework with Gregory Rosu , and the Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) and Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) programs with Matthew Might . Ive been involved in the development of: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , the Chez Scheme compiler , the X10 language , the Habit compiler , and the K Framework .
