Our research focuses on computational approaches to problems in molecular biology. In particular, we are interested in exploring gene regulation, mostly in metazoan genomes, and in the biological contexts of development, behavior and cancer. We approach the subject through an integrated analysis of DNA sequence, gene expression, and epigenetic data. We also strive to understand how sequences involved in gene regulation have evolved. Broadly speaking, our work falls in the areas of regulatory and comparative genomics . Principal Investigator : Saurabh Sinha.
