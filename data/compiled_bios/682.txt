 Grant Schoenebeck Grant Schoenebeck I am excited to announce that starting Fall 2019, I will be an assistant professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan School. I am currently in the Computer Science and Engineering Division at the University of Michigan. I am looking for new PhD students! Please apply to UMSI and include my name in your application. I am interested in a wide range of students including those interested in computer science theory topics, those interested in applications of these topics (e.g. in social networks, political divisiveness and polarization, information elicitation mechanism, etc.), and those looking to combine theoretical and applied approaches.

I attended Harvard University, graduating with highest honors in mathematics. Afterwards, I attended Oxford University as the von Clemm fellow and studied theology. I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in computer science where I was advised by Luca Trevisan. Subsequently I was the Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Computer Science at Princeton University.
