 Hari Kalva Professor and Associate Chair; Director, Multimedia Lab Dept. of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Spring 2017 Office hours (EE96/440): Mon, 2:00 PM -- 5:00 PM or by appointment Research Research Overview Our research interests are in the areas of visual information processing that considers the entire video pipeline -- capture, compression, communication, and consumption. We are interested in understanding how visual perception, cognition, and emotion can help optimize video services. One key area of focus is understanding and applying human visual perception, cognition, and social context to optimize video quality and reduce bandwidth needed for video services. Standardization Research We are actively involved in research related to audio-visual compression and communication standards. Our work includes low complexity encoding and transcoding of HEVC, AVC/H.264, and MPEG-2. A related area of focus is video encoding and delivery optimization for mobile devices. Applying and optimizing WebRTC for realtime services is another area of interest.
