Applications to optical character recognition, zip code reading, face detection and recognition, automatic anatomy identification in medical images, detection and recognition of acoustic signals. Computational efficiency is emphasized. Statistical modeling and analysis of the data for understanding the performance of the algorithms. Parallel and biologically plausible neural architectures for implementing these algorithms involving interactions with research on biological visual and acoustic pattern recognition.
