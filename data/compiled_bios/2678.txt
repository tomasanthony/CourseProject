 Chiu C. Tan Home :: Research :: Publications :: Teaching :: C.V About Me I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University . I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from the College of William and Mary , and my B.S in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics, both from the University of Texas at Austin . My research interests lies in next generation computing systems. These systems often utilize the widespread deployment of mobile and embedded sensor devices, high bandwidth wireless coverage, and inexpensive cloud computing infrastructure, to support new applications. My current research interests are environment-based security (the use of environment conditions to build security protocols), and mobile/wearable systems for dementia patients. I am looking for new Ph.D. students with an interest in systems research. I am also willing to advise Temple undergraduate and MS students looking for independent study and/or master project.
