 Matthew Berger Assistant Professor Vanderbilt University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Office: Jacobs Hall 379 Phone: (615)-343-2016 Email: matthew.berger@vanderbilt.edu About Me I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University . I was previously a postdoc at the University of Arizona , advised by Prof. Joshua A. Levine . Before that, I was a researcher with the Air Force Research Laboratory. I received my PhD in Computing from the University of Utah , where my advisor was Claudio T. Silva , and did my MS and undergrad in Computer Science at Binghamton University . Research Interests My research is in the area of data visualization. I develop techniques that help people visually explore and make sense of large and complex data. I am particuarly interested in leveraging and developing machine learning techniques for this purpose. My research considers what can be learned from all aspects of visualization, such as data, visual encodings, and user interactions, in order to improve the process of visual exploration. Update. I am actively looking for PhD students and postdocs. If you are interested in visualization or machine learning please feel free to contact me.
