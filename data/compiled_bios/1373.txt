 Arnab Bhattacharyya Home Research Teaching Students Welcome !I am an assistant professor at the School of Computing , National University of Singapore . I am currently on leave from the Computer Science and Automation Department at the Indian Institute of Science . My research area is theoretical computer science, in a broad sense. More specifically, I am interested in algorithms for big data, computational complexity, analysis and extremal combinatorics on finite fields, and algorithmic models for natural systems. See my publications for more details. News Excited to receive an Amazon Research Award to support my work on causal inference! Our paper "Minimum Intervention Cover of a Causal Graph" was accepted at AAAI 2019. I just joined the Computer Science Department at NUS. Please come by my office and say hi!
