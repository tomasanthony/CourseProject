Biography My research interests lie primarily in the modeling of infectious diseases, both on the molecular level (using approaches from computational and systems biology) as well as on the population level (using approaches from epidemiology and biostatistics). I am particularlly interested in the interactions between science, medicine and policy as they relate to improving patient outcomes, especially in low-income, low-resource settings. I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from MIT and a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University . My doctoral work focused on metabolic models of tuberculosis (TB). I have been working in Ted Cohen's group since September 2012. I recently submitted a paper on a joint model of the TB and HIV epidemics in Southern Africa and I am currently working on identifying mixed TB infection in a population. Between my PhD and my postdoctoral fellowship I worked as a computational biologist at Pfizer , developing methods for interpreting gene expression, genetic and metabolomic data using a large network of known biological relationships . I also spent some time working at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Clinton Health Access Initiative . News I am actively looking for excellent, highly motivated graduate students and postdoctoral fellows (see the ad on MathJobs ). If you are interested in working on any of these topics please send me an email! In February 2016 I was selected as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in Computational and Evolutionary Molecular Biology. See the announcement on the Simon Fraser University website . Q & A with Leonid Chindelevitch: Can computer models predict pandemics? Research As an applied mathematician I use a variety of mathematical methods to address one of today's most pressing problems: infectious disease epidemics. I am pursuing a cross-disciplinary approach to the study of infectious disease that incorporates computational biology, phylogenetics, epidemiology, and economic gametheory. Computational biology: analyzing metabolic networks, with applications to M.tuberculosis. My doctoral research involved the modeling of the metabolism of TB. I developed an algorithmic pipeline called MetaMerge which allowed me to reconcile differences in format, nomenclature, and annotation between two models of TB metabolism. MONGOOSE , another doctoral project of mine, is a tool for analyzing metabolic network models in exact arithmetic, resulting in consistent, reproduciblepredictions. Epidemiology: compartmental modeling of the tuberculosis-HIV/AIDS co-epidemic. As part of my postdoctoral research I developed a compartmental model that accounts for the joint natural history of TB and HIV. I calibrated this model to data available for South Africa and used it to investigate the effects of various interventions aimed at reducing the burden of these diseases in order to help policy-makers select the most impactful and cost-effective one among manyalternatives. Phylogenetics: analyzing prevalence and transmission patterns of mixed tuberculosisinfection. I am developing a method for elucidating the genetic forces at play in the TB epidemics in South Africa and South America by using the TB strains' MIRU-VNTR fingerprints. My method integrates uncertainties about the strain composition of a sample and the phylogenetic relationship between the strains into a robust algorithmic framework to identify patients with mixed infections or mutatingstrains. Economic game theory: modeling the alignment of incentives between public and privatesector. I am currently pursuing a collaboration examining the economic incentive structures for the interaction between public and private medical sectors in India. Using a principal-agent paradigm and incorporating the stochasticity of the health outcomes allows us to combine a population-level stochastic model of the course of an infectious disease epidemic with a game-theoretic model of dynamic contractnegotiation.
