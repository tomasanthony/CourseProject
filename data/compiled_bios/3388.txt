 Pedro Felipe Felzenszwalb Professor of Engineering and Computer Science Office: Barus & Holley 355 Phone: (401) 863-1531 Email: pff (at) brown.edu Office hours: Monday 3-4pm CV Research My main research interests are in computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning and discrete algorithms. I have worked on a range of different problems within computer vision, including the low-level problem of image restoration, the "mid-level" problem of image segmentation, and the high-level problem of object recognition. My research involves connections between computer vision and artificial intelligence to a variety of areas including combinatorial optimization, stochastic models, machine learning, and natural language processing.
