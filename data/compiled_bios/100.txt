Boris Kozinsky works at the intersection of fundamental physics of materials properties, efficient computational algorithms, and data-intensive informatics approaches. The overall vision is to leverage the rapidly expanding power of computation and data science to accelerate discovery and design of new practical materials needed for breakthroughs in energy storage and conversion systems. Performance of these systems is controlled by atomic-scale transport and reaction mechanisms and their coupling at different length and time scales that are difficult to probe by experiment alone. Atomistic and electronic structure computations are emerging as a powerful tool for understanding and distilling the design rules governing quantum-level microscopic effects.Boris Kozinsky studied at MIT for his B.S. degrees in Physics, Mathematics, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and received his PhD degree in Physics also from MIT in 2007. He then established and led the atomistic computational materials science team at Bosch Research in Cambridge MA, working closely together with leading academic and industrial groups. Leveraging over a decade of experience in industrial application-driven research, Boris Kozinsky emphasizes technological relevance and rapid screening methods for high performance materials and devices, in close collaboration with experiments. His work on development and application of computational methods led to advances and inventions in a wide range of materials systems, including 1D and 2D materials, piezoelectrics, thermoelectrics, batteries, super-ionic conductors, catalysts, and functional polymers.Current work is focused on:Design and discovery of materials for next-generation batteries, fuel cells and sensors using computations of electronic structure of correlated oxides, electrochemical activity and stability, and ionic conductivity of cathodes and solid electrolytes.Development of accurate and efficient computational methods by combining first-principles quantum calculations with multiscale analytical models of transport, lifetimes and coupling of electronic, thermal and ionic carriers.Machine learning approaches for accelerated materials discovery by identifying structure-property relationships and computable descriptors of complex materials properties, and by enhancing accuracy and efficiency of computational methods.Database-driven cloud infrastructure for intelligent automation of computational workflows, enabling exascale data generation, reusability and analytics.http://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu
