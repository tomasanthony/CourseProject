Farzad Farnoud, Assistant Professor Farzad Farnoud is an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto in 2008. From the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he received his MS degree in mathematics and his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2012 and 2013, respectively. His research interests include the information-theoretic and probabilistic analysis of genomic evolutionary processes; rank aggregation and gene prioritization; and coding for flash memory and DNA storage. He is the recipient of the 2013 Robert T. Chien Memorial Award from the University of Illinois for demonstrating excellence in research in electrical engineering and the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Data Storage Best Student Paper Award.
