Teaching The courses I teaching this year (2018/2019) is: APS100H1F - Orientation to Engineering This course is designed to help students transition into first-year engineering studies and to develop and apply a greater understanding of the academic learning environment, the field of engineering, and how the fundamental mathematics and sciences are used in an engineering context. Topics covered include: study skills, time management, problem solving, successful teamwork, effective communications, exam preparation, stress management and wellness, undergraduate research, extra- and co-curricular involvement, engineering disciplines and career opportunities, and applications of math and science in engineering. Official Course Description Course Website (Requires Login) ECE259H1S - Electromagnetism The fundamental laws of electromagnetics are covered; including Coulomb's law, Gauss' law, Poisson's and Laplace's equations, the Biot-Savarts law, Ampere's law, Faraday's law, and Maxwell's equations. Vector calculus is applied to determine the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields and their sources (charges and currents). Field-matter interaction is studied, including polarization in dielectric materials and magnetization in magnetic materials. Circuit elements such as the resistor, capacitor and inductor are introduced from an electromagnetic point of view. Other topics include: electric and magnetic forces, the electric potential, capacitance and inductance, electric and magnetic energy, magnetic circuits, boundary-value problems and transmission-lines.
