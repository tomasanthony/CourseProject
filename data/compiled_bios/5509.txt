Zhiru Zhang Associate Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 320 607/255-5954 zhiruz@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Prof. Zhiru Zhang joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in August 2012 and was elevated to the rank of associate professor in July 2018. He is a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory. Prof. Zhang received an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received a B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University. In 2006, he co-founded AutoESL Design Technologies, Inc. based on his dissertation research on high-level synthesis (HLS). AutoESL was acquired by Xilinx in 2011 and its HLS tool is now known as Vivado HLS, which is the first mainstream and most widely deployed C-based design tool for FPGAs. Prior to joining Cornell, he served as a software development manager at Xilinx, where he received the 2012 Ross Freeman Award for Technical Innovation, the highest technical award given by Xilinx. Prof. Zhang's research has earned several awards, among them a best paper award from the ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), a Best Short Paper Award from IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM 2018), and multiple best paper nominations (ICCAD 2009, FPGA 2017, FPGA 2018).. Research Interests Prof. Zhang's research broadly investigates new applications, optimization algorithms, and design automation tools for heterogeneous computing. recent publications focus on the topics of high-level synthesis, accelerator architectures, programming for FPGAs, and algorithm-hardware co-design for machine learning.
