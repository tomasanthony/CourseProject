Dow Building T: (734) 647-6821 Bio Projects Publications Research Facilities Group EDUCATION: B.S. (Physics), University of Michigan, 1988 M.S. (Applied Physics), Cornell University, 1992 Ph.D. (Materials Science), University of California, San Diego, 1995 ALSO: Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, and Physics Associate Director, Applied Physics http://www.researcherid.com/rid/J-9091-2012 CURRENTLY TEACHING: MSE250 Principles of Engineering Materials RESEARCH INTERESTS: In the Goldman Research Group, we develop strategies for manipulating and identifying atoms in functional inorganic materials for high efficiency solar cells, long-wavelength light-emitters and detectors, high temperature electronics, spintronics, and quantum computing. Our emphasis is on understanding processing-structure-property correlations in semiconductor films, nanostructures, and heterostructures. We are primarily experimentalists using ultra-high vacuum techniques including molecular-beam epitaxy (million buck evaporator), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and both blanket and focused ion implantation. We have recently developed computational efforts aimed to assist in our understanding of solute incorporation in alloys (Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations of ion-solid interactions) and plasmon-enhanced light-emission from semiconductor nanocomposites (electromagnetic simulations of light-matter interactions) PRIOR EXPERIENCE: Academic experience University of Michigan Applied Physics, Associate Director, 2010- present Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Education Director, 2011-17 Energy Frontiers Research Center, Associate Director, 2009-14 MSE, Graduate Program Advisor, 2008-12 MSE, EECS and Physics, Professor, 2008-present Physics, Associate Professor, 2007 EECS, Associate Professor, 2004-07 MSE, Associate Professor, 2003-07 MSE, Assistant Professor, 2000-03 MSE, Dow Corning Assistant Professor, 1997-99 Harvard University Engineering & Applied Sciences, Visiting Scientist, 2006 Radcliffe, Augustus Anson Whitney Fellow, 2005-06 Carnegie Mellon University , Physics, Postdoctoral Fellow, 1996-97 Non-academic experience Thomson CSF , Laboratoire Central de Recherches (Orsay, France), Research Assistant, 1988 Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY), Research Assistant, 1986 AWARDS AND SERVICE: Awards National and International (recent and selected) Fellow of the American Physical Society, 2012 Fellow of the American Vacuum Society, 2012 Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, 2008 Augustus Anson Whitney Fellow, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard, 2005-06 Best Student Oral Presentation (Advisor), Electronic Materials Conference, 2004 Peter Mark Memorial Award, American Vacuum Society, 2002 National Science Foundation Career Award, 1998-2003 MRS Graduate Student Award (equivalent to Gold Award), 1994 Minnesota Educational Computer Consortium Contest, 1st place award, 1978 University, College, Department (recent and selected) Senior Fellow, Michigan Society of Fellows, 2017-21 Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, 2016 Senior Fellow, Sweetland Writing Center, 2014 Monroe-Brown Foundation Service Excellence Award, 2011 Outstanding Achievement Award, 2010 Ted Kennedy Family Team Excellence Award, 2004 Dow Corning Assistant Professorship, 1997-1999 Williams Award, Physics Department, 1988 Alumni Giving Scholarship, 1984 Service activities National and International Department of Energy, Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Scientific Advisory Committee, 2017-2020 Swedish Academy of Sciences, Goran Gustafson Prize Award Committee, 2016 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicines Report: Assessment of Solid-State Lighting, Phase 2, Reviewer, 2016 Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Committee of Visitors, 2013 National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Energy Frontiers Research Center, Advisory Committee, 2011-2015 Program Chair, North American Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy, 2011 Program Chair, Physics and Chemistry of Semiconductor Interfaces, 2008 Editorial (recent) Associate Editor, Journal of Applied Physics, 2017 present Editorial Board, MRS News, 2012present Associate Editor, Journal of Electronic Materials, 200217 Associate Editor, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, 200106 University and College (recent) Member, President's Honorary Degree Committee, 2017-20 Member, Dean's Advisory Committee on Female Faculty, 2017-20 Member, CoE Executive Committee, 2014-17 Member, LSA Sweetland Writing Center Executive Committee, 2015-18 Member, Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs, 2010-13 Member, Provosts Capital Projects Review Committee, 2010-13 Member, General Counsels Advisory Committee, 2010-16 Member, Student Relations Advisory Committee, 2010-16 Member, Rackham Divisional Board, 2003-05 Member, Academic Senate Assembly, 2002-05 Faculty Advisor, Society of Women Engineers, 1998-2003 MSE Department Chair, Curriculum Committee, 2013-14 Chair, Graduate Committee, 2008-12 Graduate Program Advisor, 2008-12 Member, Chair's Advisory Committee, 2007-11 Member, Graduate Committee, 2003-13 Chair, Advanced Materials & Processing Education Center Taskforce, 1998-2003 Member, Undergraduate Committee, 1997-2003 Leadership in professional organizations AVS Science & Technology Society Trustee (2009-11);
