I am particularly interested in extending the range of user's states and traits that can be reliably captured in a computational user model and leveraged for adaptation - from purely cognitive features (knowledge, skills, goals), to affective states (emotions, moods, attitudes), to meta-cognitive skills (e.g., the capability of effectively exploring a large information space) and personality traits. I have over 100 peer-reviewed publications in the fields of Intelligent User Interfaces, User Modeling, Affective Computing, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Intelligent Virtual Agents. My research has received awards from a variety of venues, including UMUAI, the Journal of User Modeling and User Adapted Interaction (2002), the International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces ( IUI 2007), the International Conference of User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2013, 2014), TiiS, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Interactive Systems (2014), and the International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA 2016). I am an associate editor for UMUAI, TiiS, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, and the Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education. I served as President of AAAC, (Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing), as well as Program or Conference Chair for several international conferences including UMAP, IUI, and AI in Education If you'd like to join our research group as a graduate student, please apply here News & Perks Check out our new papers accepted at IJCAI 2017, IUI 2017, AIED 2017, EDM 2017 Best Paper Award 2016 at IVA 2016, 16th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents NSERC Discovery Grant Accelerator, 2016-2019 Best Paper Award 2014 in ACM Transactions on Intelligent Interactive Systems (TiiS) Best Paper Award at UMAP 2014 Runner Up for Best Paper Award at ITS 2014 > Runner Up for Best Paper Award at IUI 2014 Best Paper Award at UMAP 2013 Killam research Fellowship 2013 Department of computer science at UBC .
