 Jason Wiese I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at The University of Utah . My research focuses on personal data. I design and build systems to address the challenges of dealing with unified personal data. To inform the design of my systems and to demonstrate their utility, I develop approaches for interpreting personal data, I create applications that leverage personal data, and I conduct user studies to understand the perspectives of users and application developers.
