Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Management Master of Science in Information Technology ManagementAs I was inspired and challenged by my professors, I aim to do the same for the students. My core teaching philosophy is to make a personal difference in the lives of my students by providing knowledge and vision, by challenging them to achieve higher goals, by showing them how to apply theoretical material to real-world scenarios, and by facilitating exploration and discussion with me and other students. My central teaching goal is help my students grow across all three dimensions of their person: cognitive, affective, and behavioral.
