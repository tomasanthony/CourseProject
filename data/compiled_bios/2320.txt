Karmanye Vaadhika-raste, Maa Phaleshu Kadachana; Maa karma-phala-hetur-bhoorma, MaTe sangostwakarmini. You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive. Nor let your attachment be to inaction. | || 14|| Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVIII, Verse 14. adhihhna tath kart karaa cha pithag-vidham vividhh cha pithak cheh daiva chaivtra pachamam. The body, the doer, the various senses, the many kinds of efforts, and Divine Providence these are the five factors of action.. : : | || Sanskrit Subhashita Anna daanam param daanam vidyaa danaam atah param . annena kshinikaa truptih yaavajjeevam cha vidyayo. Serving food to the needy is a charity of high order and so also teaching some one free of charge. Whereas food gives momentary satisfaction to the recipient, the satisfaction of becoming learned remains with the recipient throughout his lifetime.
