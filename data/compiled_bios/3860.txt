Katharina Reinecke is an assistant professor at University of Washington Computer Science & Engineering focused on human-computer interaction, intelligent user interfaces and cross-cultural usability of technology. She earned her Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Zurich in Switzerland and her diploma (comparable to M.Sc.) in computer science from the University of Koblenz in Germany. Katharina researches how people of different cultural backgrounds interact with computers to develop technology that is culturally intelligent, automatically adapting its look and feel to peoples varying preferences and abilities to improve user satisfaction and performance. Based on her research, Katharina developed a culturally adaptive web application that composes personalized user interfaces based on a person's current and former countries of residence. To collect the large amounts of data needed to inform the design of these adaptive user interfaces, Katharina co-founded LabintheWild , a virtual lab launched in 2012 that has obtained data from nearly 3 million users from over 200 countries through online behavioral studies. Katharina previously was an assistant professor in the School of Information and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Before that, she was a postdoctoral fellow in the Intelligent and Interactive Systems Group in Harvard Universitys School of Engineering & Applied Sciences. Katharina has earned numerous awards for her work, including Best Paper Award and Best Paper Honorable Mention at CHI 2013 and CSCW 2015, a Best European Paper of the Year Award for her MIS Quarterly publication on culturally adaptive user interfaces, and a Best Paper Award at UMAP 2009.
