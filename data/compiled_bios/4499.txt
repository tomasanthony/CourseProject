She directs the research programs in Distributed Data Intensive Systems Lab ( DiSL ), examining performance, availability, security, privacy, trust, data mining, and data management issues in big data systems, cloud computing, distributed computing systems and big data powered deep learning sysems. Prof. Liu and the DiSL research group have been working on various aspects of distributed data intensive systems, ranging from Big Data systems and data analytics, Cloud Computing and cloud datacenters, distributed systems, decentralized and social computing, mobile and location based services, sensor network and event stream processing, to service oriented computing and architectures. She has published over 300 international journal and conference articles. Her research group has produced a number of open source software systems, among which the most popular ones include WebCQ , XWRAPElite , PeerCrawl , GTMobSIM , and SHAPE . Prof. Dr. Liu is a recipient of IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award (2012) and an Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Advisor award from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012. She has published over 300 international journal and conference articles and is a recipient of the best paper award from numerous top venues, including ICDCS 2003, WWW 2004, 2005 Pat Goldberg Memorial Best Paper Award, IEEE Cloud 2012, IEEE ICWS 2013, Mobiqutious 2014, APWeb 2015, IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2015, IEEE Symposium on Big Data 2016, IEEE Edge 2017 and IEEE IoT 2017. Prof. Dr. Ling Liu has served as a general chair or a PC chair of numerous IEEE and ACM conferences in data engineering, very large databasesBig data, and distributed computing fields, and most recently, the PC chair of IEEE ICDCS 2017 and a co-PC chair of IEEE 2016 Big Data Conference. Prof. Liu has been on editorial board of over a dozen international journals, and served as the Editor In Chief of IEEE Transactions on Service Computing (2013-2016). Prof. Dr. Liu's current research is primarily sponsored by NSF, IBM, and Intel.
