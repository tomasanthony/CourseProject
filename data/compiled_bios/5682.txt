Before that, I finished my first Ph.D. in Computer Science from Northeastern University China where I was advised by Prof. Guiran Chang in 2014. I also worked in industry for two years. I am looking for undergraduate students, and graduate students (both MS and PhD students) to work with me. Visiting students/scholars are also welcome.
