I am a teaching fellow in Computer Science department, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences. My initial teaching load includes courses: Computer Logic,Networking and Mobile Computing.I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from computer science and engineering department, school of sciences and engineering, the American University in Cairo (AUC).I received my Ph.D. degree from the computer science and engineering department, faculty of engineering, The University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia. Afterwords, Ijoined University of Sydney as a research fellow in the centre of infectious diseases and microbiology,workingin high performance computing for computational biology problems, and clustering and classification of DNA sequences. Then moved to academic teachingin the college of engineering and technology, the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt. I was teaching parallel algorithms, graph theory, programming, computer graphics, computational theory, computer algorithms, and pattern recognition courses.In Surrey, I was first appointed as a research fellow in CVSSP working on a survey of source separation algorithms. I started with Blind source separation methods: NMF, ICA, Sparse Representations, and neural networks supervised solutions such as RNN, CNN, CRNN. I am trying to compare all these methods performance on the musDB of SiSec 2018.I am teaching this semester,Spring 2019, the following modules:COM1032 Mobile Computing Module:https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2019-0/module/COM1032COM2022Computer Networking Module:https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2019-0/module/COM2022Computer Science BSc (Hons)I am supervising 3 MSc students, and 4 Graduating Students.A list of my publications is available on:http://www.manalhelal.com/publications/
