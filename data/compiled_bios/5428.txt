 Ajitha Rajan ajitha.rajan AT gmail.com Home CV Publications About Me I am a Lecturer (or Asst. Professor in American terms) and Chancellor's Fellow at the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh (since December 2012). Previously, I was a post-doc at Oxford University, Computer Science Department and at Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble (LIG) at Grenoble, France. I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in Aug 2009. My PhD advisor is Prof. Mats Heimdahl . My Research My research is in the field of software engineering and strives to address challenges in software validation and verification. I am especially interested in Machine learning applied to the test oracle problem - Automatically classifying test executions as pass/fail. Defining quality metrics for GPU programs . I am interested in coverage metrics for code, design, and requirements (functional, non-functional, security). Automated test case generation and execution for blockchain applications and GPU programs . Optimising energy consumed by software . We investigated the energy consumed by software design patterns and proposed compiler optimisations for a couple fo the patterns in recent work. Economic models for incremental software and software on the cloud. I am looking for PhD students. Research topics should be in the field of software enginnering. Fully funded PhD positions are available for UK/EU students. Exceptional overseas students will also be considered.
