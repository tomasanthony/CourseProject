My Erdos Number is 2 (Dodis Spencer Erdos, or Dodis Winkler Erdos). My current H-number (aka h-index) is 59 . Old favorite of mine: Putnam Exam . Favorite year: 1995 . Tribute to my favorite mathematician: Leonhard Euler . I often check Cryptography E-Print and Complexity ECCC Archives. My OLD MIT page . Fun Puzzles: Think Clear , Magic Ball , Hacker , Square , Briangle , BrainFood , BridgeCross , Stop Lenin . I enjoy playing badminton with NYU Badminton Club . In a Lighter Vein Interested in a PhD ? Perhaps in Theoretical CS ? Or Math ? You need motivation , note-taking and production . Then come conference talks , the defense , the fame , the press and the wishful prayer . Ever zoned out at a party? Get real , learn to dance or grab a beer ! Some "deep stuff" (try reloading!), inspired by these deep analogies . How (not) to evolve . More on cats and dogs , men and women . Best "applied" research paper ever. The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest . Tired of long movies? Try 30-Second Bunnies Theatre . Are you a native Russian? Check here or here or here , or here . Alternatively, check your logic in Russian . Are you a native English? Check here . New York NYU : students' top choice and dream school . The New Yorker and the New Tork Times . Going Out? Check TimeOut or CitiSearch . Local Movies (or here ). I recommend Angelika and Lincoln Plaza theaters. Tired of Broadway ? Try Off or even Off-Off Broadway. See also NYT Section . Find out the Weather (I use this ). Google Local Map . Last modified: January 25, 2019. Thanks for visiting.
