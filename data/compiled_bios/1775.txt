 David E. Johnson School of Computing, University of Utah Home Research Teaching Service Publications My research interests lie in the development of practical operations on geometric models and their application to challenging problems in areas such as haptics, computer-aided modeling, robotics, and human-computer interfaces. I strongly believe that interdisciplinary collaboration motivates theoretical developments in computer science, as well satisfying solutions to real-world problems. Similarly, teaching and outreach activities create venues for finding new applications for computational tools and for developing the relationships to explore them. These activities are intrinsically tied to the research process. Current Teaching Spring 2016 CS1030 Foundations of Computer Science MW 2:00-2:50 CS3505 Software Practice II TH 2:00 - 3:20 Office Hours My office is MEB 3146, which is in on the west face of the 3rd floor of MEB. If you leave the SoC main office by the back side door, I am two doors down from there. I am generally available or by appointment. Please check class schedules for my formal office hours.
