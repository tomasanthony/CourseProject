 Tim Rocktschel Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing Short Bio I am looking for students interested in doing a Ph.D. with me at the Department of Computer Science at University College London . Please follow these instructions and get in touch in case you have any questions! I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research London and a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer Science at University College London . Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Whiteson Research Lab , a Stipendiary Lecturer in Computer Science at Hertford College , and a Junior Research Fellow in Computer Science at Jesus College , at the University of Oxford . I obtained my Ph.D. in the Machine Reading group at University College London under the supervision of Sebastian Riedel . I received a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Natural Language Processing and a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Scholarship . I worked as a Research Intern at Google DeepMind in Summer 2015 under the supervision of Edward Grefenstette . In 2012, I received my Diploma (equivalent to M.Sc) in Computer Science from the Humboldt-Universitt zu Berlin . Between 2010 and 2012, I worked as a student assistant and in 2013 as research assistant in the Knowledge Management in Bioinformatics group of Ulf Leser . My research focuses on the design of sample efficient and interpretable machine learning methods by incorporating prior knowledge in symbolic and textual form. His work is at the intersection of deep learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, program induction, and formal logic.
