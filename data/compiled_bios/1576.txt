I often work on these topics: Graph algorithms Algorithms under uncertainty Algorithms for resource allocation and scheduling Combinatorial optimization Algorithms in Internet search, advertising, and e-commerce Algorithms in networking and social networks Algorithms in game theory and computational economics If you are a prospective PhD student interested in theory/algorithms, please apply to the Duke Computer Science PhD program and send me a short note. For more details of our theory group, please check out our theory wiki . If you are a current Duke undergraduate student and want to do research in theory/algorithms, please send me an email with your interests and background (e.g., performance in relevant courses). I am part of the Indo-US Virtual Networked Joint Center on Algorithms under Uncertainty .
