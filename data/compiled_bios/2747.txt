 About Me Dr. Fabio Papacchini Research Associate at the University of Liverpool Department of Computer Science , Knowledge Representation Group Currently working on the EPSRC iTract project Room 1.09, Ashton Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK E-mail: Fabio.Papacchini@liverpool.ac.uk I am a Research Associate at the University of Liverpool since September 2015. My research interests include Knowledge Representation, OBDA, Query Answering, Rewriting, Automated Reasoning, Tableaux Methods, Modal Logics, Description Logics and Model Generation. Before coming to Liverpool I have been an EPSRC Doctoral Prize fellow at The University of Manchester, the same university where I obtained my PhD in January 2015 under the supervision of Dr.-Ing. Renate A. Schmidt. Before that, I obtained my BSc and MSc in Computer Science Engineering at the "Universit degli Studi Roma Tre" under the supervision of Prof. Marta Cialdea Mayer .

Proceedings of the 18th Automated Reasoning Workshop (ARW 2011) Link Slides Poster Academic Responsibilities 2017/2018 I have contributed to the preparation of the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liverpool. My contributions include: designing of tutorials, slides, class tests and exam questions. I have also been a demonstrator for the course. 2016/2017 I have designed and ran a Protg tutorial for the course Ontology Languages at the University of Liverpool. I have been a demonstrator for the course Logic in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. I have given a guest lecture for the course Research Methods in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. 2014/2015 I was a teaching assistant for the course Automated Reasoning and Verification during the academic year 2014/2015 at The University of Manchester. 2010 - 2013 I was supervising and teaching in labs (example classes), marking assessed coursework for the course of Algorithms and Imperative Programming from 2010 to 2013 at The University of Manchester. Public Engagement I, together with Francis Southern, organised and ran a workshop on Logic and Computing as part of the Discovery Computer Science event at The University of Manchester on 3 December 2014. Slides I revisited, organised and ran a workshop on Logic and Computing as part of the Discovery Computer Science event at The University of Manchester on 15 July 2015.
