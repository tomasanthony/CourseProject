There, he leads the Situation Awareness and Visual Analytics team. His research experience and interests include: visual analytics, information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer network defense, and computer-supported cooperative work; he is particularly interested in the intersection between these areas. His work has included research into the work practice and collaborative work flows among Computer Network Defense analysts and the design of systems to facilitate the exploration and knowledge building activities inherent in that domain. He is also a Joint Faculty member in the University of Tennessee's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the former Assistant Director of the Center for Intelligent Systems and Machine Learning (CISML) at the University of Tennessee. Before coming to ORNL, Dr. Goodall was a Research Scientist with Secure Decisions. There, he led an effort for DHS S&T to develop visualization solutions to aid analysts at US-CERT in sifting through billions of network flow records looking for malicious activity. For an Air Force Research Laboratory directed Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract, he led an effort to develop a model of mapping cyber assets, missions and users, and methods to populate, query and visualize this model. For a DHS S&T SBIR he led the development of a system to bring together multiple software security analysis tool results into a unified framework that enabled developers to visually explore and understand the security posture of their source code. Dr. Goodallholds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Information Systems from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). He has served as the Chair of the Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) in 2007 and 2008 and co-chair in 2009, and published on the topics of visualization and the work practice of CND analysts.He has been on the program committee for IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis) and ACM Computer Human Interaction for the Management of Information Technology (CHIMIT).
