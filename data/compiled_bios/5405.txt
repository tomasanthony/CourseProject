 Advanced Robotics Lab People Projects Publications Open Positions Education Contact Us Welcome to the Advanced Robotics Lab Our goal is to control the dynamic behaviour of a wide variety of robotic systems, particularly articulated floating base systems, e.g. humanoids and quadrupeds. In order to best utilize the hardware facilities in the ECR , we are interested in producing skilful, agile, athletic, and well coordinated physical motions and interactions for the humanoid Valkyrie, the ANYmal quadruped, and bi-manual Husky robots. Research Directions Control algorithms for dynamic robot motion: dynamic locomotion, multi-contact mobility, loco-manipulation. Torque/impedance control for safe and compliant physical-interactions. Machine learning for versatile locomotion of humanoid robots. Transferring human motor control and coordination skills to humanoids.
