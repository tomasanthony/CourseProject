Broadly, my research interests lie in the area of computer and networked systems. I take a holistic approach towards solving real-world problems considering both theoretical and systems perspectives. I am interested in designing solutions rooted in fundamental theory and in building systems that employ these solutions and insights to advance the state-of-the-art. In the recent past, my research has focused on fault tolerance, resource efficiency, load balancing and reducing latency in large-scale distributed data storage and caching systems. We designed coding theory based solutions that we proved are theoretically optimal; we also built systems using these solutions and evaluated them on Facebook's data-analytics cluster and on Amazon EC2 showing significant benefits over the state-of-the-art. The solutions that we proposed are now a part of Apache Hadoop 3.0 and under consideration by several companies for use in their storage and analytics products.For more details on my research, please visit my homepage: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/
