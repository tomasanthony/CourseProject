I designed and developed the Stork distributed data scheduling system currently used by institutions worldwide; and the PetaShare distributed storage network that managed close to a Petabyte of storage located across nine university campuses in Louisiana. I am currently working on data scheduling and optimization as a cloud-hosted service ( OneDataShare ); and energy-efficient data transfers for green Internet ( GreenDataFlow ). Major application areas of my research include genomics, health sciences, emergency response, and coastal and environmental sciences.
