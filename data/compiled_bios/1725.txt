We consist of one professor, a band of graduate students, and a cohort of undergrads - but more importantly we're curious people who enjoy writing code, playing with UNIX, and seeing what social media can tell us about the human condition. In our research we seek to develop new ways of measuring and modeling large-scale human behavior including online social platforms, NYT bestsellers, human communities, political parties, and ancient civilizations.
