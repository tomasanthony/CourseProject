 Meagan S. Mauter Associate Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering and Engineering & Public Policy Contact 5111 Scott Hall Email 412-268-5688 Address Civil & Environmental Engineering Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 Bio Professor Meagan Mauter holds bachelors degrees in Civil & Environmental Engineering and History from Rice University, a Masters of Environmental Engineering from Rice University, and a PhD in Chemical and Environmental Engineering from Yale University.She completed post-doctoral training in the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and the Mossavar Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, where she was an Energy Technology Innovation Policy Fellow. At Carnegie Mellon University, Professor Mauter runs the Water and Energy Efficiency for the Environment (WE 3 Lab) and is jointly appointed in Civil & Environmental Engineering and Engineering & Public Policy. She also holds courtesy appointments in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering. Her present research seeks novel approaches to sustainably meet water supply in an energy constrained world by re-thinking the policies surrounding water treatment, re-defining the inputs to the treatment process, and re-envisioning the membranes in membrane-based water treatment processes. Education 2012-2013:Visiting Scholar, Energy Technology Innovation Policy Research Group, Science Technology and Public Policy Program, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. 2011 2012: Research Fellow, Energy Technology Innovation Policy Research Group, Science Technology and Public Policy Program, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs / Mossavar Rahmani Center for Business and Government, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. 2008: M.Phil - Yale University 2006: BA; BS; MEE - Rice University Research Research Group: EESS Research Activity in the Water and Energy Efficiency for the Environment Lab Professor Mauter's research group, the Water and Energy Efficiency for the Environment (WE 3 ) lab , works to enable energy efficient water treatment technologies by addressing the technical and structural barriers to their implementation.Recent work has focused on the development of membranes with improved mass transfer and fouling resistance, desalination technologies that leverage low temperature heat as an energy input, and processes for treating alternative feed streams, including high salinity oil and gas produced water and low salinity brackish water.
