 Parth H. Pathak HOME RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS TEACHING I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University . Before joining Mason, I was a postdoc at University of California, Davis where I worked with Dr. Prasant Mohapatra . I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2012. I received the UC Davis award for excellence in postdoctoral research for 2015. RESEARCH INTERESTS The focus of my research is to make wireless networks and mobile systems more efficient, accessible, robust and truly pervasive. I am currently interested in the following topics - Next-generation wireless networks, especially 60 GHz millimeter wave networks, visible light communications RF sensing, mobile/wearable sensing for applications like healthcare and mobile interaction, drone sensing and networking Cyber-physical systems, smart indoor spaces, Internet-of-Things and low-power networking Multiple Research Assistant Positions Available: Looking to recruit PhD, visiting scholars, MS and undergraduate students interested in wireless networking and mobile computing related research.
