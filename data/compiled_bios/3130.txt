Interested students should be skilled programmers able to rapidly develop solutions that test new ideas. Research Interests I am interested in pushing the difficult or tedious tasks involved with software development onto computers. Whether finding or explaining bugs, generating effective tests, identifying potential optimization opportunities, or some other task, people have difficulty with the subtle and repetitive behaviors required for maintaining high quality software. By automating these subtle tasks, we can improve both the lives of developers and the quality of the software they produce. I am particularly interested in program analyses that facilitate debugging, test suite assessment, and hardening programs against attackers.
