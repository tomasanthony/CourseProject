Ugo  Buy Associate Professor Department of Computer Science Contact Building & Room: 1130 SEO Office Phone Voice: (312) 413-2296 Email: buy@uic.edu Related Sites: View full profile About My research interests are in the general area of software engineering with emphasis on modeling and analysis of concurrent and real-time systems. In the past, I have investigated various methods for automatic verification of these systems using such models as finite automata and Petri nets. In recent years, I have shifted my main research focus to the automatic generation of control supervisors for discrete manufacturing systems. For instance, I codirectedNIST-sponsoredproject seeking to generate automatically supervisory controllers for discrete manufacturing plants. More generally, I am now interested in techniques for supervisory control and dynamic reconfiguration of discrete event systems. An additional application is the automatic correction of multi-threaded Java programs required to be free of deadlock and to comply with user-specified safety properties. Additional interests include software development for multicore hardware, mobile app development, and sensor networks. Teaching: I usually teach courses on object-oriented programming languages (CS 342 and CS 474), software engineering (CS 342, CS 440, CS 442 and CS 540), and mobile app development (CS 478). In the past, I have also taught introductory computer-science classes (CS 100 and CS 101), data structures (CS 201), and theory classes (CS 301 and CS 401).
