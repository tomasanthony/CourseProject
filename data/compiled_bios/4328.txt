Hessam Sarjoughian  Hessam Sarjoughian is co-founder and co-director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Modeling & Simulation. His research has been supported by NSF, Intel, DARPA, and Boeing among others. Sarjoughian is a Founding Member of the Certified Modeling & Simulation Profession, a Certified Modeling & Simulation Professional, and a recipient of the SCS Distinguished Service Award. Sarjoughians industry experience has been with IBM and Honeywell. Sarjoughians research focuses on heterogeneous modeling theories and methodologies that can lead to building composable and scalable simulation frameworks. Key research areas are multi-formalism modeling, collaborative visual modeling, agent-based simulation, distributed simulation, and software architecture. His work has been adopted in research, industrial, and educational settings. Research outcomes have contributed to engineering and sciences of enterprise computing systems, cyber-physical systems, and human-natural systems. He has been the architect and the lead for the DEVS-Suite simulator, which is being used at universities and research institutes in many countries across Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Sarjoughians educational aim is to further Modeling & Simulation as an established academic discipline.
