Phone: 530-752-8393 Email: last name at cs dot ucdavis dot edu Research Interests: I am a data scientist specializing in a number of applied areas Empirical Software Engineering: In our DECAL research group we develop theory and methods (based on statistical models and data mining) to aid in the understanding of and improving the software engineering processes in complex, distributed and collaborative socio-technical environments (mostly OSS projects). We are finding that the social component is necessary for understanding the technical contributions and vice-versa. UC Davis is Ranked Number 5 in USA in Software Engineering by csrankings.org! Systems Biology and Gene Networks in Plants: With plant biologists from the US Forest Service and UC Davis we study interesting properties of plants and mutants and tie them to the underlying biochemistry linking their genes among each other. In particular, we conduct RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and other experiments, and then integrate the large-scale genomic data sets coming out of them into biological models of plant growth. Applied Network Theory: I also contribute to more theoretical work on understanding the topological structure and characterizing complex networks in various domains, including the modeling of biological, software and social networks. Data Mining And Algorithms: In the past I worked on consensus clustering algorithms and biological data integration and analysis methods.
