 Steve Marschner Professor Computer Science Department Graphics & Vision Group Cornell University publications research teaching contact cv home My research and teaching are in computer graphics and vision, centered around how optics and mechanics determine the appearance of materials. I got my Ph.D. from Cornell in 1998, and held research positions at HP Laboratories , Microsoft Research , and Stanford University before I rejoined Cornell in 2002.
