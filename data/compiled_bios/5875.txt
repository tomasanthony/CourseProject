His research group is currently involved in the development and analysis of computational methods for formation of positron emission tomography (PET) images with applications in clinical oncology and gene expression imaging in small animals. For the past 15 years, Dr. Leahy has been involved in the development of inverse method for spatio-temporal imaging of neural activity from measurements of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. The results of this research are distributed to the research community in the form of a freely available software package, BrainStorm. Dr. Leahy has also had a long research interest in the analysis of anatomical imagery, and specifically in the automated segmentation and labelling of neuroanatomical images and in extracting surface representations of the cer! ebral cortex from volumetric data. His work is supported by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Center for Research Resources.Awards2011 International Society for Functional Source Imaging (ISFSI) Elected Fellow of the ISFSI2010 IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society Edward J Hoffman Medical Imaging Scientist  Award2009 Institute of Physics / Physics Med.
