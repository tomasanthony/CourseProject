Damian completed his Ph.D. in 2009 from Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Prior to joining UCF, Dr. Dechev worked for Sandia National Laboratories and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Dechev specializes in the design and analysis of multiprocessor data structures and algorithms. Dr. Dechevs research in multiprocessor algorithms design has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Department of Energy. Projects TLDS: Transactional Lock-free Data Structures TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones. It includes five examples of transactional data structures, lock-free and obstruction-free versions of a linked list, and a skip list, and a lock-free hash map. We are currently working on supporting transactional data structures for non-linked containers and also transactions that are executed on multiple containers. CCSpec CCSpec is a tool that allows the user to check that their concurrent data structure meets a specified correctness condition. A correctness condition for a concurrent data structure defines the expected behavior of method calls. CCSpec can check any correctness condition in which a concurrent data structure is expected to exhibit equivalent behavior to the sequential counterpart. Tervel Tervel is a framework and library that unifies methodologies and techniques to enable the efficient implementation of wait-free algorithms. It includes a unified memory reclamation structure, progress assurance scheme, and a construct that limits recursive helping. It advocates a call-back centric design pattern to reduce code duplication, observable states, and improve code readability.
