 Jump to Content Marc Niethammer Overview Research Teaching Contact Bibliography Software You are here Home Overview My research interests lie in the areas of biomedical image analysis and visual control- and estimation-theory. I am interested in both theory development and applications to real world problems. My areas of expertise range from visual tracking for defense applications, to medical imaging algorithm development, to structural health monitoring (in a former life). I am excited by interdisciplinary work, having collaborated and worked with researchers and practitioners in mathematics, various engineering disciplines, and in the medical fields. I am particularly interested in the interplay between disciplines, where theory drives applications and applications influence theory development. My recent research focuses on biomedical image analysis. I am particularly, interested in novel methods for segmentation and registration involving temporal or spatial constraints. My current application areas are (1) neuroscience and neurodevelopment, (2) osteoarthritis, (3) pediatrics, and (4) cancer.
