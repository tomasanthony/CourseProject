Language and X {vision, knowledge, world, mind, society...} : Intelligent communication requires the ability to read between the lines and to reason beyond what is said explicitly. My recent research has been under two broad themes: (i) learning the contextual, grounded meaning of language from various contexts in which language is used both physical (e.g., visual) and abstract (e.g., social, cognitive), and (ii) learning the background knowledge about how the world works, latent in large-scale multimodal data. More specifically, my research interests include: Language Grounding with Vision: Learning semantic correspondences between language and vision at a very large scale, addressing tasks such as image captioning, multimodal knowledge learning, and reasoning. Physical Commonsense Reasoning: Learning naive physics type knowledge from language and other modalities; modeling action causality and entailment using frame semantic style representation. Social Commonsense Reasoning and Connotation Frames: Modeling connotative implications of actions and events; modeling why people do (intent) what they do and the (emotional) causal impact of different actions and events. Language Generation and Conversational AI: Modeling the long-term context; tracking and simulating the world representend in a story or a narrative; learning to write; integrating physical and social commonsense in storytelling AI for Social Good: fake review / news detection; political factchecking; identifying unwanted bias in modern films and literature Recent Publications (2016 - 2018): From Recognition to Cognition: Visual Commonsense Reasoning ( VCR ) Rowan Zellers, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, Yejin Choi. arXiv:1811.10830 *Project Page ATOMIC : An Atlas of Machine Commonsense for If-Then Reasoning Maarten Sap, Ronan LeBras, Emily Allaway, Chandra Bhagavatula, Nicholas Lourie, Hannah Rashkin, Brendan Roof, Noah A Smith and Yejin Choi *Project Page SWAG : A Large-Scale Adversarial Dataset for Grounded Commonsense Inference Rowan Zellers, Yonatan Bisk, Roy Schwartz and Yejin Choi Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018. *Project Page *Leaderboard QuAC: Question Answering in Context Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wen-tau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang and Luke Zettlemoyer Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018. *Leaderboard Neural Metaphor Detection in Context Ge Gao, Eunsol Choi, Yejin Choi and Luke Zettlemoyer Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), short paper, 2018.
