Building reliable distributed systems means guarding against both hardware and software failures. My research spans fault-tolerant replication and formal verification of systems software. In my most recent projects, I have demonstrated how formal verification can be applied to complex distributed systems; I have shown that the ACID paradigm is not fundamentally slow, but can be made to perform well if one separates the ACID guarantees from the mechanism that implements them; and I have shown how to rearchitect the 40-year-old idea of State Machine Replication to accommodate multithreaded execution. These days, I mostly work on making formal verification practical by applying it to complex systems in new and interesting ways and by automating the process of proving the correctness of these systems.
