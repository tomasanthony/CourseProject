Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee. He received his B.S, M.S.E.E., and Ph.D. all from the University of Tennessee. He worked for Hewlett-Packard Co., E.G. & G. ORTEC, and North American Philips prior to coming to ORNL. He has worked on electronics for PHENIX at RHIC, heavy-ion experiments at CERN, SANS detector electronics for the SNS, solid state neutron detectors, and the first 2-D neutron pixel detector. His career focus has been in the area of custom integrated circuit design for a variety of disciplines. He most recently was involved in the design of fast, low-power mixed-signal CMOS electronics for The Fieldable Nuclear Materials Identification System (FNMIS) for NA-22, the Time-Projection-Chamber (TPC) upgrade for the ALICE collaboration at CERN, radiation-hardened analog integrated circuits for space exploration and reactor accident cleanup applications and direct-sequence, spread-spectrum (DSSS) radio communications for remote sensor applications. In addition, he is currently managing the hardware development for the Authenticatable Container Tracking System (ACTS) for the DOE EM Packaging Certification Program. He has over 100 publications 21 issued patents in the field of electronics and integrated circuit design. He is the recipient of a 2014 R&D100 award and is also Associate Editor, IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science.
