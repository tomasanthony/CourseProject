He had received his BSc degree in Mathematics and Physics from Queen's University in 1964 and went on to complete his MA (1965) and PhD (1968) degrees at the University of Toronto under the supervision of William Kahan and Kelly Gotlieb respectively. He had an NSERC post doctoral fellowship at the University of Eindhoven (the Netherlands) in 1968-69 (under the joint supervision of Jaap Seidel and Edsger Dijkstra) and joined the faculty at the University of Toronto in Jan. 1970. He served as the chair of the Department from July 1985 to June 1990, the Director of Research Initiatives for the Faculty of Arts and Science, from July 1991 to March 1998, Acting Vice President of Research and International Relations from Sept. to Dec. 1993, and Academic Coordinator of Bell Canada University Labs at the University of Toronto from April 1998 to June 1999. He retired in July, 2010 and is currently Professor Emeritus in both the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics. His research is primarily in graph theory; this interest spans theoretical, algorithmic and application issues. Most of his resent research attention has been on Graph Searching. He has supervised or co-supervised the completion of 26 PhD and 35 MSc theses. His doctoral graduates are currently in academic or industrial positions in 8 countries, as well as 6 provinces in Canada. He is the author or co-author of over 100 refereed research publications.
