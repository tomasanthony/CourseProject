Print Email We are the Combinatorial Scientific Computing Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We focus on problems involving computations on large graphs. As a result, our research is often conducted at the intersection of several fields, including numerical linear algebra, parallel computing, and scientific computing. People at the CSC Lab Dr. John Gilbert Current Members: Kevin Deweese , Veronika Strnadova Past Members Aydin Buluc , Viral B. Shah , Vikram Aggarwal , Imran Patel, Varad Deshmukh, and Adam Lugowski For more information about past and current lab members, please refer to our People page. Projects Current Projects Knowledge Discovery Toolkit (KDT) : A toolkit which provides domain experts with a simple interface to analyze very large graphs quickly and effectively without requiring knowledge of the underlying graph representation or algorithms. The Combinatorial BLAS (CombBLAS) : High-performance parallel primitives for graph analysis and mining. The primitives are based on sparse linear algebra and implemented in MPI/C++ for distributed memory parallelism. Past Projects High Productivity Computer Systems : Petascale computing with an emphasis on programmer productivity Star-P: A tool for interactive numerical and combinatorial computing. Circuitscape : Using circuit theory to design connected landscapes. Powered by Joomla!
