 Montek Singh is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at theUniversity of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. He received thePh.D. degree in computer science from Columbia University in 2002, and the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi, India, in1993. His general research interest is in the area of high-performance andenergy-efficient digital systems. He is particularly interested inthe design of asynchronous or clockless and mixed-timing integrated chips, including circuit design, and CAD tools for automatedsynthesis, analysis and optimization techniques. His interests alsoinclude applications to energy-efficient mobile graphics hardware; applications to the design of secure chips and to computer security;and design challenges of emerging computing technologies. In 2005, he was brought onto the DARPA CLASS Program (led by Boeing),to develop, in collaboration with Philips/Handshake Solutions, anindustrial-strength automated synthesis ow for designing high-speedasynchronous systems. His work has been transferred to industry,including IBM, Boeing, and Handshake Solutions (a Philips subsidiary). He received the Best Paper Award at the 2000 IEEE ASYNC Symposium,Best Paper Finalist Nominations at ASYNC 2002 and ASYNC 2008, and anIBM Faculty Award in 2004. He is/was Program Committee Co-Chair forASYNC 2007 and ASYNC 2012, and General Chair for ASYNC 2009. He is aco-Guest Editor of upcoming special issues (fall 2011) on asynchronousdesign of IEEE Design & Test of Computers, and ACM Journal on EmergingTechnologies of Computing Systems (JETC).
