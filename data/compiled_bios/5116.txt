 Home Short cv Research Publications & talks Teaching Roberto Palmieri I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Lehigh University where I co-lead the SSS - Scalable Systems Software Research Group with Prof. Michael Spear. Previously, I was Research Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech . My research interests focus on different aspects of concurrency, synchronization, distributed computing, and distributed systems, spanning from theory to practice. I am passionate about designing and implementing synchronization protocols optimized for a wide range of deployments, from multicore architectures to cluster-scale and geo-distributed infrastructures. Software and Hardware Transactional Memory technology is one of my preferred areas of research. I am looking for motivated students who are enthusiastic about theory and practice of concurrency, synchronization, distributed systems, and/or any topic that falls into my areas of interest (see Research ). If you are interested in working with me, please contact me immediately.
