Toussaint Professor and Head of Computer Science , New York University Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Collaborator, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology The Schulich School of Music McGill University and Professor Emeritus , Killam Research Fellow School of Computer Science McGill University Montreal, Canad a I am a Professor and Head of Computer Science at New York University Abu Dhabi, in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. During the 2010-11 academic year I was a Research Scholar at Harvard Universit y in the Department of Music , doing research on computational music cognition, and a Visiting Scholar and Lecturer at Tufts University in the Department of Computer Science . In 2009-2010 I was the Emeline Bigelow Conland Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, working on a research project on the phylogenetic analysis of the musical rhythms of the world . Since 2005 I joined the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CRMMT) in the Schulich School of Music, at McGill University, as a Collaborator. My primary research interests include: (1) the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems that arise in pattern recognition, music information retrieval, computational music theory, computer vision, visualization, computer graphics, computer-aided design, automated manufacturing, knot theory, polymer physics, and computational biology, (2) comparative musicology , with special emphasis on the mathematical and computational aspects of rhythm, and (3) the application of geometry to art in general, and to pattern analysis and design in particular. I am also interested in the history of computing, especially the famous Greek computer from antiquity: the straight edge and compass . --> This Home Page was born on January 20, 1997.
