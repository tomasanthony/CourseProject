Rajeev's research is aimed at improving technology for design and analysis of reliable software systems. His team is interested in developing specification logics for formalizing correctness requirements, modeling notations for constructing modular descriptions of complex systems, and verification algorithms for checking systems against requirements. Current projects include software synthesis, programming abstractions for querying streaming data, and finding performance bugs in code for parallel hardware architectures.
