I currently coordinate introductory computer science courses for non-majors at Rutgers. Prior to my position at Rutgers, I taught computer science and math at Drew University and, prior to that, I taught computer science and math at Westfield High School. I have served on the Test Development Committees for College Board AP CS A and AP CS AB and was co-chair of the AP CS Principles Test Development Committee. I have been involved in K-12 CS Teacher Professional Development since 1985 and currently serve as a CS consultant for College Board. I am also on the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) Board of Directors serving as Chapter Liaison.Most broadly, my research area is computer science education. My dissertation research investigated the characteristics that contribute to the perceived effectiveness of pedagogical tools used in introductory programming classes. My current research focuses more on pedagogical approaches to teaching computer science in ways that promote diversity, particularly by implementing cooperative learning structures in introductory computer science courses to promote equal engagement of all students.
