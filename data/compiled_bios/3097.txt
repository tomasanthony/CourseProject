 Sara Mathieson Visiting Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Swarthmore College phone: 610.690.5525 office: Science Center 249 email: smathieson [at] cs [dot] swarthmore [dot] edu Teaching Current Semester Previous Courses Research Publications Lab Talks Other Bio I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Swarthmore College . I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2015 from UC Berkeley where I was advised by Yun S. Song . My research areas include computational and population genetics, with a focus on demographic inference. I am generally interested in developing statistical and machine learning methods for problems in biology.
