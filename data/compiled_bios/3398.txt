 Serdar Kadolu Home Publications Service Software Teaching Resources Home Publications Resources Service Software Teaching Home Contact: Oracle Corporation 10 Van de Graaff Drive Burlington, MA, USA 01803 Currently, I serve as the vice president of AI at Fidelity Investments and an adjunct faculty member in the Dept. of Computer Science at Brown University. Previously, I led the Advanced Constraint Technology R&D team at Oracle. My algorithmic research is focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Optimization, while my practical interests are in building robust, scalable, data-driven products that address business-c ritical problems. I received my Ph.D. at Brown University under the supervision of Meinolf Sellmann . My thesis work explored deterministic inference methods for constraint satisfaction, search protocols for constrained optimization, and stochastic local search. I also worked at Adobe developing an AI-based test case generator for the ActionScript virtual machine and was a researcher at Astra Group on Combinatorial Optimization hosted by Prof. Pierre Flener . Outside of work, I am an avid soccer fan; playing, watching and coaching.
