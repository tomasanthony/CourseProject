Sara Eftekharnejad Assistant Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 3-191 CST 315.443.4447 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D., Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, 2012 MSc. , Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, 2008 BSc., Electrical Engineering, University of Tehran, 2006 Research Interests: Integration of renewable energy into power systems Power system stability and control Power system reliability and security Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) in smart grids Current Research: My research focuses on integration of renewable energy resources and power system stability with high penetration of renewables. I investigate how power systems are impacted when various renewables are integrated into systems. I also investigate how power system operation and planning needs to be modified to accommodate more renewables while achieving reliable power systems. I also investigate the problems at the intersection of network science theory and power system analysis. This includes identification of critical contingencies and solutions to prevent cascading blackouts.
