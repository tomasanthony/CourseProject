Jayadev Acharya Assistant Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 382 acharya@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography I joined Cornell in August 2016 as an Assistant Professor in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, after spending two years as a postdoc at MIT. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of California, San Diego, and my B. Tech degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.. Research Interests I am interested in information theory, algorithmic statistics, and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in understanding the trade-offs between resources (e.g., data, memory, time, etc) for problems in statistical learning. During my graduate work, I worked on compression and statistical estimation, with particular emphasis on problems over large domains.
