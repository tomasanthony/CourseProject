 Qixing Huang Assistant Professor The University of Texas at Austin GDC 5'422, Austin, Texas 78751 Email: huangqx at cs.utexas dot edu Short Bio Qixing Huang obtained his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2012. From 2012 to 2014 he was a postdoctoral research scholar at Stanford University. From 2014 to 2016 he was a research assistant professor at Toyota Technological Institue at Chicago. He received his MS and BS in Computer Science from Tsinghua University. He has also interned at Google Street View, Google Research and Adobe Research. His research spans computer vision, computer graphics, computational biology and machine learning. In particular, his recent focus is on developing machine learning algorithms (particularly deep learning) that leverage Big Data to solve core problems in computer vision, computer graphics and computational biology. He is also interested in statistical data analysis, compressive sensing, low-rank matrix recovery, and large-scale optimization, which provide theoretical foundation for much of his research.
