Our research focuses on abstracting the essential properties of natural evolution that made it possible to discover astronomically complex structures such as the human brain. Our work is in part an approach to artificial intelligence. I developed a method, called NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) , that begins evolution with a population of very simple networks and complexifies the networks over generations by adding new neurons and connections. We recently developed an extension to NEAT called HyperNEAT that can evolve neural networks with millions of connections and exploit geometric regularities in the task domain. Here is a page on fracture in CPPNs and HyperNEAT . Another new approach that we recently introduced is called novelty search . Unlike most evolutionary algorithms, novelty search has no defined objective; instead it simply searches for novel behaviors. Nevertheless, it finds surprisingly robust solutions, raising questions about fundamental assumptions on why search works. I discuss some of my research interests in several interviews that are available online: This audio interview (9/30/06) conducted by Tom Barbalet for biota.org discusses some of my general interests. In this text interview (12/11/08) with AIGameDev.com, I discuss Galactic Arms Race and my thoughts on automatic content generation for video games through evolution. A TV interview (on G4TV) from February 2010 also discusses GAR. In yet another text interview , I discuss GAR with Game Developer Magazine in April 2010. Before joining UCF, I was a member of the UTCS Neural Networks Research Group . Gunter Bachelier created a gallery of computerized portraits of myself , generated through an evolutionary process, as part of our recognition for winning the Best Paper Award at EvoMUSART 2008 . Gunter added another set here Teaching New: Fall 2015: NeuroEvolution and Generative and Developmental Systems (CAP 6616): Syllabus | Lectures and Assignments Old: Spring 2014: AI for Game Programming (CAP 4053): Syllabus | Lectures and Assignments Previous Courses Taught NEAT and HyperNEAT Users Derek James runs a NEAT Users Group on Yahoo.

A fascinating exhibition of complexification and the evolution of form. NEAT-based Genetic Art (CPPN Explorer) Programs and Other CPPN Applications For an introduction to the theory behind Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), which explains how the patterns produced by these programs are possible to evolve, please refer to our paper Exploiting Regularity Without Development . DelphiNEAT-based Genetic Art Tool. Mattias Fagerlund released this tool first, which allows you to explore evolved images generated through NEAT-evolved CPPNs. The interface makes it a great neural network learning tool, and other developers followed suit. SharpNEAT-based Genetic Art Tool . Inspired by the DelphiNEAT Genetic Art tool, Holger Ferstl created this newer genetic art tool with SharpNEAT. It includes some novel schemes for evolving pictures with color. The files are also available with permission from Holger from my local server: Executable (requires .NET 2.0) ; Full Source JCPPN . William Monti created this Java-based CPPN explorer, including the version of NEAT that powers it. It includes HSL color and the ability to input texture files into the CPPN and manipulate them. djNEAT. This program by Wade Spires and Brendon Moore (started as a project in my neuroevolution class) implements interactive evolution of audio effects. It is like the image explorer programs except it produces sounds instead of images. Evolving a 2D Model of an Eye using CPPNs : This document is a Masters Thesis by Anders Storsveen completed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Department of Computer and Information Science, under the supervision of Professor Keith Downing. It is interesting because it is a unique application of CPPNs outside the usual domains. Some of the work was completed while Anders visited the Evolutionary Complexity Research Group at UCF in 2008. Selected Publications Journal Conference (For a full list of my publications please see my vita ) Paperback Book Available with Chapter on NEAT This book by Mat Buckland provides a nice overview of NEAT intended for general (i.e. non-academic) audiences: AI Techniques for Game Programming .
