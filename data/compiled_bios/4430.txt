At BU I am a member of the Data Management Lab@BU. My research interests are in the area of algorithmic data mining with emphasis on (social) network analysis, recommendation systems, ranking and clustering. From 2007 to 2009, I was a Research Staff Member at IBM Almaden Research Center. Until 2007, I was with Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT). In December 2006, I defended this. I was fortunate to have Heikki Mannila as my advisor.
