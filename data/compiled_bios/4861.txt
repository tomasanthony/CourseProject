I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Brandeis University. My research is concentrated in Systems, and in particular, large-scale data management including databases and query optimization, and niche data management systems such as columnar data management architectures and streaming data management systems.Currently, my group is working on applications of software engineering principles to the design of Database Management System (DBMS) components. As well, we are interested in the management of data resulting from human-in-the-loop complex processes.
