Tomovs research interests are in parallel algorithms, numerical analysis, and high-performance scientific computing (HPC). He has been involved in the development of numerical algorithms and software tools in a variety of fields ranging from scientific visualization and data mining to accurate and efficient numerical solution of PDEs. Currently, his work is concentrated on the development of numerical linear algebra libraries for emerging architectures for HPC, such as heterogeneous multicore processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and Many Integrated Core (MIC) architectures. In particular, he is leading the development of the Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures ( MAGMA ) libraries, targeting to provide LAPACK/ScaLAPACK functionality on the next-generation of architectures. Tomov is also a Principal Investigator of the CUDA Center of Excellence ( CCOE ) at UTK , and Co-PI of the Intel Parallel Computing Center ( IPCC ) at ICL . Tomov received a Master of Science in Computer Science from Sofia University,St. Kliment Ohridski, Bulgaria in 1994 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics fromTexas A&M University in 2002. He worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratorybefore joining ICL in 2004. Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science TICKLE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING Site Map Min H.
