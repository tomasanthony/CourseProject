Biography Niloy Mitra is a Professor of Geometry Processing in the Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). He received his MS and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University under the guidance of Leonidas Guibas and Marc Levoy , and was a postdoctoral scholar with Helmut Pottmann at Technical University Vienna . His research interests include shape analysis, computational design and fabrication, and geometry processing. For details, please visit the SmartGeometryProcessing page. Niloy received the 2013 ACM Siggraph Significant New Researcher Award for "his outstanding work in discovery and use of structure and function in 3D objects" (UCL press release ) and the BCS Roger Needham award (BCS press release ) in 2015. He received the ERC Starting Grant on SmartGeometry in 2013. His work has twice been featured as research highlights in the Communications of the ACM, twice been selected by ACM Siggraph/Siggrraph Asia (both in 2017) for press release as research highlight. Besides research, Niloy is an active DIYer and loves reading, bouldering, and cooking.
