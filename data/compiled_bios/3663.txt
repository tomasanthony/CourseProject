 Neuroimaging & Brain Dynamics Group Home Research People Publications Contact Welcome! Our goal is to increase understanding ofthe human brain by advancing functional neuroimaging methodology. We develop approaches for extracting information about brain activity in health anddisease by combining neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and computational signal analysis techniques. Our research is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, bridging fields such as engineering, computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and medicine. We are at Vanderbilt University in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science . We are alsoaffiliated with the Department of Biomedical Engineering , the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS) , the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE) , and the Vanderbilt Brain Institute (VBI). More information about our current research can be found here , and you can find our publications here . Postdoctoral position We are currently seeking a postdoctoral fellow with expertise in fMRI data analysis.
