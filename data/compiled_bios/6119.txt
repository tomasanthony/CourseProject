Biao Chen Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 3-179 CST 315.443.3332 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph. D., University of Connecticut Lab/Center Affiliation(s): Communication Laboratory Research Interests: Statistical inference applied to decentralized systems Network information theory Signal processing for MIMO, multi-user, and multi-carrier communications Current Research: My current work focuses on decentralized inference and in particular, how inference functions can impact the value of information in a networked system. Specific topics of interests include the sufficiency principle in the decentralized setting that guides optimal data reduction, the role of feedback and interactive communication in networked inference, and architectural issues in data fusion systems. Another area of current interest is in characterizing the performance limits of multi-user networks, and in particular the classical interference channel. On the applied side, we have been involved in developing MIMO communication systems for airborne platforms when MIMO channels exhibits rank deficiency due to the lack of scatterers and in developing robust, efficient, and secure software radio systems.
