Monnier, Stefan	I'm interested in pushing the limits of strongly typed programming languages so as to be able to use in circumstances where they are currently inapplicable. For example, designing advanced type systems that make it possible to write secure low-level code such as automatic memory management. More generally I'm interested in type systems that enable the programmer to explain to the compiler, via type annotations, why his program is correct.
