 Donnie Pinkston - Caltech Computer Science Welcome to my Caltech CMS homepage. I am a lecturer, teaching the following courses: CS11 - Programming Language Shop CS24 - Introduction to Computing Systems CS121 - Introduction to Relational Databases CS122 - Relational Database Implementation CS123 - Projects in Database Systems CS124 - Operating Systems I also wrote and administer the csman homework submission system that we use for CS1, CS4, and CS11. (I wrote it in Django , which is my favorite web framework for when I have to throw together complex websites all by myself.) I work with Mike Vanier , the other lecturer in the CS department. He has a lot of interests, just like me. NanoDB Since 2005 I have been working on NanoDB, an instructional relational database implementation written in Java, which we use in CS122 and CS123. NanoDB uses SQL for DDL and DML operations. It has basic support for B + trees, transactions, and a few other nifty features. It has continued to grow in complexity as students have made contributions to the codebase over the years. If you are interested in considering NanoDB for use in a database course or project, please let me know.
