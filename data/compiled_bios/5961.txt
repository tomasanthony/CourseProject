Massoud Pedram received a B.S. degree in EE from the California Institute of Technology in 1986 and a Ph.D. degree in EECS from the University of California, Berkeley in 1991. He then joined the EE department of USC where he is currently a professor. Dr. Pedram has served on the technical program committee of many EDA conferences, including the Design automation Conference (DAC), Design and Test in Europe Conference (DATE), Asia-Pacific Design automation Conference (ASP-DAC), and International Conference on Computer Aided Design (ICCAD).  He served as the Technical Chair and General Chair of the ISLPED in 1996 and 1997, respectively. He has published four books, 80 journal papers and more than 200 technical conference papers. His research has received a number of awards including two ICCD Best Papers, two DAC Best Papers, and an IEEE T-VLSI Best Paper.  He is a recipient of the NSF's Young Investigator Award (1994) and the Presidential Faculty Fellows Award (a.k.a. PECASE Award) (1996).  Dr. Pedram is a Fellow of the IEEE, VP of Publications for the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, an IEEE Solid State Circuits Society Distinguished Lecturer, a board member of the ACM Interest Group on Design Automation, and an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computer Aided Design. His current work focuses on devel-oping design methodologies and techniques for low power electronics, power conversion and regulation, and timing, power, and temperature analysis of CMOS VLSI circuits.Research SummaryMy research interests cover the areas of computer-aided-design (CAD) of VLSI circuits and systems with emphasis on developing methodologies and techniques for low power design, dynamic power management in electronic systems, smart battery technology and design, noise analysis and minimization in integrated circuits, and design flows and algorithms for unified RT-level synthesis and physical design.Awards2008 ACM Distinguished Scientist2008 Symposium Technical Program Committee Honorable Mention Award at the 2008 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design2007 IEEE CAS IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Guillemin-Cauer Best Paper Award2007 IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Guillemin-Cauer Best Paper Award2005 42nd ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference Best Paper Award2005 IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference Best Paper Award2000 1989 and 2000 IEEE Int'l Conference on Computer Design, VLSI in Computers and Processors Best Paper Award2000 ACM SIGDA Distinguished Service Award2000  Fellow of Professional Society1996 IEEE Circuits and Systems Society VLSI Systems Transactions Best Paper ward1996  Presidential Faculty Fellows / Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers1996 33rd ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference Best Paper Award1994 NSF Young Investigator Award1992 NSF Research Initiation Award1990 IEEE Int'l Conference on Computer Aided Design Distinguished Paper Citation1989 IEEE Int'l Conference on Computer Design, VLSI in Computers and Processors Best Paper Award- 2008 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design Honorable Mention AwardAppointmentsResearch Productivity or Research Stipend , Research productivityResearch Productivity or Research Stipend , Multi-university IARPA ProjectMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Systems OfficeEEB 300BHughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2562 Contact Information(213) 740-4458pedram@ceng.usc.eduWebsitesResearch WebsitePersonal Website"]
