 Home Research Teaching Advising Service Arun Kumar Assistant Professor Computer Science and Engineering University of California, San Diego Email : arunkk [at] eng [dot] ucsd [dot] edu Office : 3218 EBU3B (CSE building) Bio Arun Kumar is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego . He is a member of the Database Lab and CNS and an affiliate member of the AI Group . His primary research interests are in data management and systems for machine learning/artificial intelligence-based data analytics. Systems and ideas based on his research have been released as part of the MADlib open-source library, shipped as part of products from EMC, Oracle, Cloudera, and IBM, and used internally by Facebook, LogicBlox, Microsoft, and other companies. He is a recipient of the ACM SIGMOD 2014 Best Paper Award, the 2016 Graduate Student Research Award for the best dissertation research in UW-Madison CS, a 2016 Google Faculty Research Award, and a 2018 Hellman Fellowship. Curriculum Vitae | Research Blog | On Twitter Recent News New! Side's paper on a non-linear variant of Morpheus gets a rare direct accept to SIGMOD 2019. Kudos to Side, the first undergraduate researcher I know to have accomplished this feat! New! The Nimbus and Tuple-Oriented Compression papers are both accepted to SIGMOD 2019! I amsterdam and all that. Represented CSE/UCSD at the oSTEM National Conference . Excited to see the high interest in computer science and data science! Also happy to spread the word on UCSD's spectacular resources and efforts on inclusivity of LGBTQ+ people. The inaugural edition of SoCal DB Day was a big success! Thank you to all the participating schools and companies. The SLAB paper is accepted to VLDB 2018 (or 2019?). Hit your ML system with SLAB to prove it is worthy! Research My current research focuses on the foundations of advanced data analytics systems that help make the process of building and deploying ML/AI-powered data analytics applications easier (improving the productivity of data scientists and ML/software engineers) and faster (improving runtime performance and introducing accuracy trade-offs). Thus, the key themes of my research are usability, developability, performance, and scalability. I enjoy working on problems that are motivated by real applications and are formally grounded. I also enjoy insightful conversations with practitioners on the frontlines of data analytics. More details about my research are available on my research group webpage , including current projects , and all of our publications .
