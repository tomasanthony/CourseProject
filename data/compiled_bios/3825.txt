 Dieter Fox | Homepage of Dieter Fox, Professor of Computer Science & Engineering Dieter Fox Menu Skip to content Home RSE-Lab Publications Teaching Contact About me I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I grew up in Bonn, Germany, and received my Ph.D. in 1998 from the Computer Science Department at the University of Bonn. I joined the UW faculty in the fall of 2000. I am currently on partial leave from UW and joined Nvidia to start a Robotics Research Lab in Seattle. Heres some info on the opening of that lab , which is located at 4545 Roosevelt Way NE. My research interests are in robotics, artificial intelligence, and state estimation. I am the head of the UW Robotics and State Estimation Lab RSE-Lab and recently served as the academic PI of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Pervasive Computing ISTC-PC . Im a Fellow of the AAAI and IEEE , and served as an editor of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics . Research: The goal of my research is to enable systems to interact with people and their environment in an intelligent way. A lot of my work focuses on perception and its connection to control, where we develop techniques to extract relevant information from raw sensor data. Application areas of my work include human activity recognition, 3D mapping and tracking, and robot manipulation and control. Students / post-docs: I am fortunate to work with a great group of graduate students, undergraduate students, and post-docs in my lab. We discuss research in weekly individual and group meetings. Publications: The research results of my group are published in the main robotics as well as AI, machine learning, and computer vision conferences and journals. Teaching: I mostly teach courses in robotics and AI, both at the undergraduate and graduate level. Undergraduate capstone courses cover robotics and interactive systems enabled by RGB-D cameras.
