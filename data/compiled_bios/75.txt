Goodwin Ave. Urbana, IL, 61801, USA ( map ) +1-217-265-6893 Im an associate professor at the CS and ECE depts. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . My primary research interests revolve around making machines that can listen . Ive done plenty of work on signal processing, machine learning and statistics as they relate to artificial perception, and in particular computational audition. I also love working on anything related to audio! The bulk of my work on audio is on source separation, and various machine learning approaches to traditional signal processing problems. I am fortunate to have been associated with some amazing research labs. I completed my masters, Ph.D. and a postdoc at the Machine Listening Group at the MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Barry Vercoe . I work with Adobe Systems Advanced Technology Labs , used to be at MERL , and have spent some time at Interval Research and Starlab . I was also a visiting scientist at MITs McGovern Institute for Brain Research . In 2006 I was selected by MITs Technology Review as one of the years top young technology innovators . I'm an IEEE fellow, was an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer for 2016-2017, and I am currently on the Board of Governors for the IEEE Signal Processing Society. Im a descendant of a long music lineage dating to the early 1600s. My Erds number is 4.
