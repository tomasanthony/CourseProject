NLP and ML Links Research Interests My primary research is in the area of natural language processing (NLP) where our goal is to develop algorithms and systems that will vastly improve a user's ability to find, absorb, and extract information from on-line text. My group's research generally proceeds at two complementary levels: we focus both on building real systems for large-scale natural language processing tasks and on developing techniques to address underlying theoretical problems in the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis of natural language. As has become more or less standard in the field, we rely on statistical machine learning techniques as our primary modeling tool, both for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underlie language understanding. Our current work encompasses a number of related areas: argument mining and argument generation including the identification of supported vs. unsupported claims and opinions, social-computational methods for improving communication and interactions in on-line settings, NLP for e-rulemaking, sentiment analysis: extraction and summarization of fine-grained opinions in text, discourse-aware methods for opinion and argument extraction, deception detection in on-line reviews, noun phrase coreference resolution. For information on these and other NLP projects at Cornell, follow this link. With colleagues from the Information Science program, I also work on: the application of NLP methods to problems in the area of digital government. In particular, we have ongoing projects in e-rulemaking . the application of NLP methods to detect deceptive language and to identify social dynamics in discourse.
