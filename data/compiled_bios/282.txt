I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at Georgetown University. I received the BSE degree in computer science from Tsinghua University in 2006, and the MSE and PhD degrees in computer science both from the University of Pennsylvania in 2009 and 2012 respectively. My research interests center on the use of data-centric and formal techniques towards ensuring safe and secure distributed systems. I am also interested in distributed data management and the application of database technologies to networked systems. Please refer to my curricum vitae and research statement for the details of my research. I am looking for motivated system students with strong programming and writing skills. If you are interested in researches in distributed systems, please contact me via email.
