Margrit Betkes research interests are in Computer Vision and Human Computation. She co-leads the Image and Video Computing Research Group in the BU Department of Computer Science. Her research focuses on the development of automated and interactive methods for detection, segmentation, registration, and tracking of objects in visible-light, infrared, and x-ray image data. She has worked on gesture, vehicle, and animal tracking, video-based human-computer interfaces, statistical object recognition, and biomedical image analysis. She has published over 100 original research papers. Since earning her Ph.D. degree at MIT in 1995, she has published over 100 original research papers. Margrit received a Career Award in 2001 for developing Video-based Interfaces for People with Severe Disabilities. She co-invented the Camera Mouse, an assistive technology used worldwide by children and adults with severe motion impairments. While she was a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, she co-developed the first patented algorithms for detecting and measuring pulmonary nodule growth in computed tomography. Margrit currently leads a 5-year research program to develop intelligent tracking systems that reason about group behavior of people, bats, birds, and cells.
