 Home Computer Science Department P.C. Rossin College of Engineering Lehigh Home James A. Femister Professor of Practice Packard Lab Rm. 200B 610-758-4073 jaf207@lehigh.edu Notices Welcome back to Lehigh! About Me Mini Bio I was a Lehigh student for many years, culminating in a Ph.D. in 1997. Throughout my career, I've kept one foot in academia and one foot in industry. In addition to Lehigh, I've also taught Computer Science at Lafayette, DeSales, Kutztown, and Alvernia. I've also worked for many years as a software engineer, consultant, and trainer for companies in New York City, North Jersey and the Philadelphia suburbs. In 2007 I returned to South Mountain to teach software engineering and recently became a Professor of Practice. Philosophy I try to bring a "real world" perspective to all my classes - considering what will best serve you when you go looking for a job.
