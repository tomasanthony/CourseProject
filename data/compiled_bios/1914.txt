Li-Yang Tan I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. My research is in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on complexity theory. More specifically, I work in circuit complexity, pseudorandomness, analysis of boolean functions, learning theory, and property testing. Before joining Stanford, I was at the UC Berkeley Simons Institute and TTI Chicago. I received my PhD from Columbia University, where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by Rocco Servedio.
