 Fabio Zanasi University College London Home Papers Talks Teaching News Undergrad Projects About Me I am a Lecturer at University College London and a member of the Programming Principles, Logic and Verification Group . Formerly I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the cole Normale Suprieure (Lyon, France), a Master of Science in Logic from the University of Amsterdam and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from the University of Siena . My research interest is in the foundations of programming language theory. The leit-motiv of my current research is the use of algebraic methods, typical of program semantics, to give a uniform, compositional analysis of computational models appearing in other fields, such as signal flow graphs, quantum processes, Petri nets and Bayesian networks.
