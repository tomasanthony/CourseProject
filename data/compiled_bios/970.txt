 Toggle navigation Home CV Publications Teaching Other Projects Blog Resources Henry Yuen University of Toronto I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics (joint appointments) at the University of Toronto. I am a member of the CS Theory group and the Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control . I am also an affiliate member of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo. My research focuses on the interplay between quantum computing, complexity theory, cryptography, and information theory. Questions that I am particularly fascinated by include: How complex can quantum states be? Can quantum computers be tested? How can quantum information be used in cryptography? What problems can be solved faster with a quantum computer?
