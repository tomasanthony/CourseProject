He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium, from 2008 to 2009. In September 2009, he joined the University of Manchester (UK), working as a Research Associate in the School of Chemistry. He was appointed as a Lecturer in technological plasmas in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool in 2012, and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2015 and Reader in 2017. Dr. Tu has been working for many years on interdisciplinary research at the interface of plasma science and chemical engineering directed towards environmental clean-up, fuel production, chemical synthesis, waste treatment, energy conversion and storage. His research has been largely focused on the development, deployment, characterisation, simulation and optimisation of novel atmospheric pressure plasma systems and processes (both thermal and non-thermal plasmas including thermal plasma jet, dielectric barrier discharge, gliding arc, rotating gliding arc, corona, etc) for gas cleaning, greenhouse gas and hydrocarbon conversion, ammonia synthesis, waste-to-energy, nuclear waste treatment and synthesis of carbon nanomaterials and novel catalysts. Significant efforts have been devoted to plasma-catalysis where the combination of non-thermal plasma and catalysis has been used as a promising low temperature process for the oxidation of gas pollutants (e.g. VOCs and PAHs) in high volume waste gas streams and for the conversion of carbon resources (e.g. CH4, CO2, tars from biomass gasification and heavy oils) into value-added fuels and chemicals such as hydrogen, olefins, liquid fuels and chemicals and carbon nanomaterials. He has established successful collaboration with both industrial and academic partners in the UK and abroad. Dr. Tu has a sustained record of high quality publications (over 80 peer-reviewed journal papers) in leading international journals such as Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ACS Catal., Appl. Catal. B: Environ., Green Chem., Environ. Sci. Technol., J. Phys. Chem. C, Chem. Eng. J., Fuels, J. Phys. D: App. Phys., Plasma Source Sci. Technol. and Appl. Phys. Lett.. He has given over 20 invited/keynote/plenary talks in a number of leading international conferences and has a sustained record of presenting (over 90) at national and international conferences. In 2014, he received a prestigious B. Eliasson Award from the International Symposium on Plasmas for Catalysts and Energy Materials to recognise his novel contributions to plasma-catalysis with emphasis on the fundamental understanding of the synergy of plasma-catalysis and nanomaterial formation in plasma. His recent award Newton Advanced Fellowship (as a host) funded by the Royal Society and Newton Fund has also demonstrated his researcher leadership at an international level. Dr. Tu has successfully organised the International Workshop on Plasmas for Energy and Environmental Applications (IWPEEA) in Liverpool from 21st to 24th August 2016, with nearly 100 participants from both academia and industry in the UK and abroad. Dr. Tu has been elected as an Associate Fellow of IChemE and a Senior Member of IEEE. He currently sits on the Science Board of SUPERGEN H2FC Hub (a Flagship RCUK Energy Programme) and served as a member of advisory board for a number of international conferences (e.g. ISNTP, ISPCEM, etc).
