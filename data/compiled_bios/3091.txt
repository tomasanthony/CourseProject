 Gerald J. Wang Assistant Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering Contact Email Address 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Bio Jerry Wang will join the CMU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Fall 2019. Wang is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. His research interests involve using mechanics, statistical physics, and high-performance computing to understand nanoscale structural and transport phenomena, with the goal of developing very small solutions for very big problems in the water-energy nexus.
