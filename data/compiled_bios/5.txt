Postdoctoral Research Associate available in Parallel Programming and C++ Library Development I am a speaker for the ACM Distinguished Speakers Program through which ACM Chapters, and other groups and organizations, can request speakers for their events. The program can provide some funding for the speaker's travel. I'm co-chair of CRA-W which is starting up a new program, the CRA-W GHC Research Scholars , that provides guidance to research-interested undergraduates on how to navigate the vast offerings at the conference and opportunities to network with other research-focused students and mentors in small-group settings, including gatherings on the first and last days of the conference and some post-conference activities. 2017 International Symposium on Robotics Research (ISRR) , Dec 11-14, 2017, Puerto Varas, Chile. Save the date and plan to submit your best work! 2016 Texas A&M Robotics Workshop , April 1, 2016, Texas A&M University. The workshop featured talks by the 2016 RSS Area Chairs who gathered at Texas A&M University to select the papers and plan the program for RSS 2016 . The workshop and RSS 2016 were great - check out photos and videos on the RSS 2016 website . 2016 Texas A&M Robotics Symposium , January 21-22, 2015, Texas A&M University. The workshop featured talks by the ICRA 2015 Senior Program Committee Members who gathered at Texas A&M University to select the papers and plan the program for ICRA 2015 . The Texas A&M Robotics Symposium and ICRA 2015 were great - check out photos and videos on the ICRA 2015 website . The Workshop on Quality Software: A Festschrift for Bjarne Stroustrup was held April 27-28, 2012 at Texas A&M University to honor and celebrate the career of Bjarne Stroustrup. PACT 2011 was held in Galveston, TX in October 2011. My favorite part was getting up close and personal with the penguins. The Workshop on Intelligent Systems: A Festschrift for Richard Volz was held April 8-10, 2010 at Texas A&M University to honor and celebrate the career of Richard Volz. RSS 2009 Workshop: Protein Structure, Kinematics, and Motion Planning was held Monday June 29, 2009, in Seattle, Washington, immediately preceeding the Robotics: Science and Systems Conference . PACT 2007 was held in Brasov, Romania in September 2007. It was definitely a PACT to remember. Excursions in Algorithmics: A Late Festschrift for Franco P. Preparata was a workshop held in October 2006 to honor and celebrate the career of my advisor, Franco P. Preparata, on the occasion of his 70th birthday. WAFR 2006 was held in New York City in July 2006. It was a great meeting.
