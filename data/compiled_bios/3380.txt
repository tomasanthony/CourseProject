CV (Sept. 2016) Research Statement Teaching Statement Acknowledgements My intrepid collaborators and co-authors! My funding agencies: the UK EPSRC, the BBC, Intel, the US National Science Foundation, and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The open source Web community: HTML5 Boilerplate , Ryan Johnston , Joshua N. Hibbert , PracticalTypography.com , and EB Garamond . Research Overview MP4 download (200MB) How can we make video a creative medium for everyone? How can computation remove barriers from interaction? How can image understanding help us explore media? To help answer these questions, I create graphics, vision, and interaction techniques which improve our understanding of the connections within media.
