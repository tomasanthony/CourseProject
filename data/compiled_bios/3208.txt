 Oded Regev About: I am a member of Courant's Theoretical Computer Science Group . My work is in the areas of cryptography, quantum computation, and complexity theory. A main focus of my research is on lattice-based cryptography, and specifically the Learning With Errors problem. For several years I am most interested in deciphering the pre-mRNA splicing code and involved in the developement of antisense drugs .
