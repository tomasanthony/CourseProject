I am a professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I am the Director of the Data Science Institute . I am also the part-time Chief Informatics Officer of the PROOF Centre of Excellence for the Prevention of organ failures . The latter is based at St Paul's Hospital. Since 2016, I have been the holder of the Canadian Research Chair on Data Science and Analytics. My research areas are data mining, text mining, health informatics, sensor analytics and data bases. As outlined in the research project section of this site, I have been focusing on genomics data and text data over the past ten years. On the genomics side, with the PROOF Centre team, my work focuses on the development of biomarker panels for various conditions related to organ failures in hearts, lungs or kidneys. On the text side, my work with the Natural Language Processing Lab focuses on conversations, such as emails, blogs and meetings. The objective is to create meta data, such as natural language summaries, to facitate access to the otherwise unstructured raw data. I joined UBC as an assistant professor in 1992. UBC is my alma mater, as I obtained the BSc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science in 1986. I continued my studies at the University of Waterloo, where I got the M.Math. degree in Computer Science in 1988. Then I went to the University of Maryland, College Park to pursue my doctoral studies, and graduated with the PhD degree in Computer Science in 1992.
