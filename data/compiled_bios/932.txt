Activities Current Program Committees DCS Women in Computing Contact info About me I am Professor of the Faculty of Arts and Science at the Department of Computer Science , University of Toronto , Canada. My main interests are in Software Engineering and in particular in Automated Verification, Software Product Lines and Model Management. My main research interests are in the use of formal methods to improve quality of software. These include: scalable automated verification techniques, including model-checking and theorem-proving; easy to read and review formal specification languages; verification of protocols; non-classical logics; reasoning under inconsistency. I am also interested in all aspects of Model Management, including support for development and analysis of heterogeneous related models and transformations between them. In addition, I am interested in supporting high quality development of sets of models, commonly done in Product Line engineering Last updated: August 18, 2016 Copyright (c) 2011 Marsha Chechik.
