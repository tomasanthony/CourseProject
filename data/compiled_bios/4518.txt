The George Washington University, Computer Science B.S. Michigan Technological University, Computer Science, Mathematical Sciences Website: https://gedare.github.io Embedded Systems Computer Security Cyber-Physical Systems Real-Time Systems Operating Systems Computer Architecture Safety and Security of Cyber-Physical Systems Resilient Critical Infrastructure Automotive Security Device Security in the Internet of Things Computer Organization I, Computer Organization II, Operating Systems, Advanced Operating Systems, Computer Architecture Dr. Bloom is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Howard University where he directs the Embedded Systems Security Lab. His research expertise is computer system security with particular focus on real-time embedded systems in critical infrastructure that have measurable lifetimes in decades. The techniques he applies to solve problems along the hardware-software interface range from computer architecture, computer security, cryptography, operating systems, and real-time analysis. He is also a maintainer for the RTEMS open-source hard real-time OS, which is used in robotics frameworks, unmanned vehicles, satellites and space probes, automotive, defense, building automation, medical devices, industrial controllers, and more. I enjoy working with open-source projects, kernel hacking, riding my bicycles, hiking, and cooking. vitae-gedare.pdf Selected/Recent (See CV for full list) E. Nwafor, A. Campbell, D. Hill, and G.
