Home Biography Publications Contact Ron Dror Associate Professor of Computer Science and, by courtesy, Molecular and Cellular Physiology Affiliated with the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Bio-X, ChEM-H, and the Biophysics Program Stanford University My primary research interests are in computational biology, with an emphasis on spatial structure and dynamics at the molecular and cellular levels. My work, usually carried out in close collaboration with experimentalists, spans fields ranging from biochemistry and cell biology to parallel computing, image processing, and machine learning. I joined the Stanford faculty in 2014, after more than a decade in industry. I enjoy working with students and postdocs from a wide variety of disciplines, including computer science, applied math, electrical engineering, biophysics, bioengineering, and chemistry. If youd like to join me in building a new research group, please contact me. Please also contact me if youre interested in collaborating, whether youre in academia or at a company.
