Yong Jae Lee Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science UC Davis Office: Academic Surge 2075 Email: yongjaelee at ucdavis dot edu Phone: (530) 752-3788 Bio / CV / Google Scholar Since July 2014, I am an Assistant Professor in the CS Dept at UC Davis. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the EECS Dept at UC Berkeley working with Alyosha Efros. I also spent a year as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (8/2012-8/2013), where I had the good fortune to work with Alyosha Efros and Martial Hebert. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2012 under the supervision of Kristen Grauman, and my B.S. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2006. I have also worked with Larry Zitnick and Michael Cohen as a summer intern at Microsoft Research.
