Dr. Shui Lam joined the Computer Engineering &amp; Computer Science Department at California State University Long Beach in 1985 after teaching at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and the University of California at Riverside. She also has several years of computer science industry experience as a technical planner and a senior systems analyst.Dr. Lam received her undergraduate education in Physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and earned her master's degree and doctorate in Computer Science from the Pennsylvania State University in 1975. Her areas of expertise and research interests include multiprocessor scheduling, optimization modeling of complex scheduling problems, simulation modeling, and performance modeling of cluster computing. She has co-authored a book on computer capacity planning and published in the Journal of the ACM, Communications of the ACM, SIAM Journal on Computing, as well as other publication venues.Dr. Lam has taught a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses and is the coordinator of various courses in computer science, including operating systems, programming languages, parallel computing, and computer graphics. Dr. Lam especially enjoys working in projects that involve students. One such project was the construction of a Beowulf supercomputing cluster in which she and two graduate students worked to acquire funding as well as non-monetary donations to build the cluster. The Beowulf cluster is currently being utilized in a graduate-level course in parallel computing developed by Dr. Lam and in directed study and research that she supervises.
