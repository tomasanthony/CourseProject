Homa Alemzadeh, Assistant Professor Homa Alemzadeh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. Homa is also an Assistant Professor by courtesy in the Computer Science Department. Before joining UVA, she was a research staff member at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. She received her Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran. Homa was the recipient of 2017 William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in Dependability from the IEEE Technical Committee and the IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance. Her work on analysis of safety incidents in robotic surgery was selected as the Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper in Adult Cardiac Surgery at the 50th annual meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and was featured in the Wall Street Journal, MIT Technology Review, BBC, NBC News, among others.
