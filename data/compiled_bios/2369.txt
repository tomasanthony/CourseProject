Kaitai is currently a lecturer (assistant professor) at SCCS (which is one of the 14 Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research recognised by the UK Government Communications Headquarters in partnership with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) and Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey, U.K. His main research interests are applied cryptography, privacy and security in information technology; in particular, encryption, signature, blockchain, cloud computing security, big data security, Internet of things, post-quantum crypto, privacy enhancing technology and lightweight secure system.He has published over 60 research works with at least 1,200 citations, related to applied cryptography in high tier security international journals and conferences (e.g., IEEE TIFS, ESORICS). He also has prepared (proposal writing) and involved into some European projects (e.g., H2020, UK, Academic of Finland) as PI or CI. He has experience in collaborating with (projects, funding and research) international industries and companies, and in teaching undergraduate, master levels computer science courses and PhD supervision.He received the Ph.D. degree in computer science (applied cryptography direction) at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Duncan S. Wong (currently CEO of CryptoBLK) in October 2014. Before joining Surrey, he was a post-doctoral researcher and a lecturer, at Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, and School of Computing, Mathematics and Digital technology, Manchester Metropolitan University, respectively.[News] Project A: Security Assessment Framework for Blockchain. This project aims to develop methodology and design mechanisms that can be applied to distributed multi-jurisdictional Blockchain and DLT systems to assess the security of these systems. The assessment should be based on well-designed security models and standards. PhD candidate will study and investigate blockchain state of art, its core mechanisms/frameworks, and the employed secure protocols (e.g., signature, zero knowledge proof, consensus) so as to design assessment criteria/models. Machine learning algorithms and formal methods will be investigated and leveraged as well. The output of the project will enable a "grading" of each blockchain to be created and shared as part of a cyber insurance policy. The PhD candidate (holding MSc. degree of Math, Computer Science, Engineering) should be equipped with adequate knowledge of programming (Python, C++, Java), basic knowledge of applied cryptography/machine learning/formal method, good communication skill, teamwork awareness, and be willing to work with industries. Project B: Minimal Identity Disclosure and Disclosure Tracing in Blockchain. Upgrading centralized identity database to decentralized network may bring convenience to identity management, sharing and tracing. However, this yields concerns on the leakage and misuse of personal identity, since the database is deployed in open network. This project aims to leverage blockchain technique to monitor identity management and its disclosure, so that the touch of personal identity can be noticed by user and furthermore, the leakage/misuse of identity can be traced. Besides, building upon Zero Knowledge proofs and the multi-faceted and usage of identities, this project will create solutions that will only disclose the minimum facets of an identity based upon the need to know of the requestor and authentication, and further evolve this to encompass situational awareness of the identity, for example hours of work, multiple roles and location of identity provision. Trusted hardware (e.g., TPM) may be considered to employ in the solutions to enhance the trust of identity usage. The PhD candidate (holding MSc. degree of Math, Computer Science, Engineering) should be equipped with basic knowledge of programming (Python, C++, Java), adequate knowledge of applied cryptography (e.g., zero-knowledge proof, signature, multiparty computation, lattice-based crypto), good communication skill, teamwork awareness, and be willing to work with industries. Project C: Secure Information Sharing in Blockchain. This project aims to develop secure algorithms and initial proof of concept that will enable information shared to be fully under the control of the consenting individual in blockchain applications. Based upon GDPR principles enable a data subject to control the consent to usage of their data and enable new means of dynamically authenticating and granting usage rights to this data. Cryptographic solutions that enables data "packets" to be wrapped and access only granted when dynamic authentication/delegation is received. "Trusted Data Sharing Module" will be built on top of trusted hardware (e.g., TPM) techniques. The PhD candidate (holding MSc. degree of Math, Computer Science, Engineering) should be equipped with basic knowledge of programming (Python, C++, Java), adequate knowledge of applied cryptography (e.g., encryption, multiparty computation, lattice-based crypto), good communication skill, teamwork awareness, and be willing to work with industries.The start date of these PhDs will be in 2019, supported by full scholarships (covering Home/EU fee and stipend of at least 14,777 pa).DBLP: https://dblp.org/pers/hd/l/Liang:KaitaiGoogle citation: https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=_qHKRH4AAAAJ&hl=enORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0262-7678"As one of the researchers in the field of applied crypto and cybersecurity, you may consider to submit your publications to Top publications in Computer Security and Cryptography".post-quantum crypto, blockchain, trusted computing, applied crypto, IoT, searchable encryption, consensus, lattice-based crypto, TPM, smart contractNewcastle University, Monash University, University of Wollongong, Deakin University,Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of New Brunswick, University of KentuckyNational University of Singapore, Singapore Huawei, I2R, NUS-Singtel Cyber Security Research and Development Laboratory, Singapore Management UniversityBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Central China Normal University, Beihang University, Guangzhou University, East China Normal University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Wuhan UniversityOsaka University, The University of Texas at San AntonioPhD students (my role):Chris Ridden with Prof. Liqun Chen (primary supervision)Stephen Holmes with Prof. Liqun Chen (primary supervision)Wei Yin (Visiting PhD) with Prof. Liqun Chen (primary supervision)Yi Zhao (Visiting PhD) with Prof. Liqun Chen (co-supervision)Long Meng with Prof. Liqun Chen (co-supervision)Kent Leeding with Prof. Steve Schneider (co-supervision)Daniel Gardham with Dr. Mark Manulis (co-supervision)Please refer to my DBLP for publications.Peng Zhang, Zehong Chen, Joseph K.
