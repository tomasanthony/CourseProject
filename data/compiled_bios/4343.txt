Sarma Vrudhula  Sarma Vrudhula joined ASU in 2005. Prior to that, he was on the faculty of the ECE departments at the University of Arizona, and the University of Southern California. He was the founding director of the NSF S/IUCRC Center for Low Power Electronics at the University of Arizona, in collaboration with the EE department of the Arizona State University. He is also the founding director of the NSF I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems at ASU. His work spans several areas in design automation and computer aided design for digital integrated circuit and systems, focusing on energy management of circuits and systems. Specific topics include: energy optimization of battery powered computing systems and wireless sensor networks; system level dynamic power and thermal management of multicore processors and system-on-chip (SoC) focusing on mobile devices; statistical methods for the analysis of process variations; statistical optimization of performance, power and leakage; new circuit architectures of threshold logic circuits for the design of ASICs and FPGAs; circuit and system architectures using emerging device technologies; non Von Neumann architectures. He was made Fellow of the IEEE in 2016 for contributions to low power and energy-efficient design of digital circuits and systems. vrudhula@asu.edu 480-727-4152 Centerpoint 203-25 Vrudhulas website Education Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, 1985 M.S., Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, 1980 B.Math., University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, 1976 Research interests CAD for VLSI circuits, logic synthesis and verification, low-power design, power, energy and thermal management in processors performance, power and yield optimization of VLSI circuits, novel logic structures and applications to biology Honors and awards  Best Researcher, Senior Faculty (SCIDSE), 2009; Best Researcher, Senior Faculty (ASU CIDSE) 2011  Key activities  Director, Center for Embedded Systems; former associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on VLSI; current associate editor for the IEEE Transaction on CAD and the ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES); former visiting scientist with Motorolas Advanced Design Tools group, Austin, TX   January 26, 2017 CIDSE                    Research Teaching Students Recognitions           Home Sarma Vrudhula at ASU Research Battery Powered Systems CAD for VLSI Energy Management of Wireless Sensor Networks Power and Energy Management of Multicore Processors Statistical Analysis and Optimization of Digital Systems Threshold Logic Students Teaching Algorithms for Computer-Aided Design of VLSI Systems CEN 691: Algorithms for Computer-Aided Design of VLSI Systems CSE 320: Design & Synthesis of Digital Hardware Digital VLSI Testing Recognitions            Sarma Vrudhula at ASU     Professor  School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University, Tempe AZ Director  NSF I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems  Sarma Vrudhula received the Bachelors of Mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in 1976, majoring in computer science and mathematical statistics. He moved to Venice CA in 1977 and while enrolled as a graduate student at in EE-Systems department at theUniversity of Southern California, worked as a research assistant in USC Information Sciences Institute in Marina Del Rey, CA. He received the M.S. and Ph.D degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1980 and 1985, respectively. During 1985-1992 he was on the faculty of the EE-Systems department of the University of Southern California. From 1992 to 2005 he was a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, AZ. During that period, he was the founding Director of the NSF UA/ASU Center for Low Power Electronics. He joined ASU in 2005, and became the director for the Center for Embedded Systems at ASU in 2006, which became an NSF IUCRC Center in 2009. He became a Fellow of the IEEE for contributions to low power and energy-efficient design of digital circuits and systems.  His work spans several areas in design automation and computer aided design for digital integrated circuit and systems, focusing on energy management of circuits and systems. Specific topics include: energy optimization of battery powered computing systems and wireless sensor networks; system level dynamic power and thermal management of multicore processors and system-on-chip (SoC); statistical methods for the analysis of process variations; statistical optimization of performance, power and leakage; new circuit architectures of threshold logic circuits for the design of ASICs and FPGAs; technology mapping with threshold logic circuits; the implementation of threshold logic using spintronic devices, and non-Boolean computation in emerging technologies. His teaching experience includes both undergraduate and graduate courses in digital systems design and testing, VLSI design, CAD algorithms for VLSI, advanced synthesis and verification methods, computer architecture, and discrete mathematics.
