[bugs] we tested matrixssl v3.7.2 for rfc compliance and other vulnerabilities. the developers of matrixssl acknowledged our findings of a collision-prone oid comparison, and ineffective expiration date checks. all of these have been fixed in newer versions. [bugs] we tested axtls 1.5.3 for rfc compliance and other vulnerabilities. the developers of axtls acknowledged our findings of certain attributes of distinguished names being ignored, certificates with unrecognised extensions are not being rejected, hhmmss of utctime being ignored, not processing any extensions (they added support for 3 extension: subject alternative name, basic constraints and key usage, in commit r273 and commit r274), and an off-by-one error in interpreting the year of utctime. fixes have been implemented or being implemented in future revision. fall 2016: joined the university of iowa as an assistant professor of computer science. summer 2016: two papers accepted in ccs 2016. students yahyazadeh moosa (ph.d. student) mitziu echeverria (ph.d. student) joyanta debnath (mcs student) bincheng wang (undergraduate student) selected publications privacy attacks to the 4g and 5g cellular paging protocols using side channel information new with hussain, syed rafiul (purdue university); echeverria, mitziu (the university of iowa); li, ninghui (purdue university); bertino, elisa (purdue university) to appear in proceedings of the network and distributed system security symposium (ndss 2019). analyzing semantic correctness using symbolic execution: a case study on pkcs#1 v1.5 signature verification new with chau, sze yiu (purdue university); yahyazadeh, moosa (the university of iowa); kate, aniket (purdue university); li, ninghui (purdue university) to appear in proceedings of the network and distributed system security symposium (ndss 2019). cves assigned to some of the bugs we found in implementations of rsa signature verification: cve-2018-15836 (openswan) cve-2018-16151 (strongswan) cve-2018-16152 (strongswan) cve-2018-16253 (axtls embedded ssl) cve-2018-16150 (axtls embedded ssl) cve-2018-16149 (axtls embedded ssl) why johnny cant make money with his contents: pitfalls of designing and implementing content delivery apps new with chau, sze yiu (purdue university); wang, bincheng (the university of iowa); wang, jianxiong (purdue university); kate, aniket (purdue university); li, ninghui (purdue university) to appear in proceedings of the annual computer security applications conference (acsac 2018). adaptive deterrence of dns cache poisoning with chau, sze yiu (purdue university); gonsalves, victor (purdue university); ge, huangyi (purdue university); yang, weining (google inc.); fahmy, sonia (purdue university); li, ninghui (purdue university) appeared in proceedings of the 14th eai international conference on security and privacy in communication networks (securecomm 2018). lteinspector : a systematic approach for adversarial testing of 4g lte with syed rafiul hussain (purdue university), shagufta mehnaz (purdue university), and elisa bertino (purdue university) appeared in proceedings of the network and distributed system security symposium (ndss 2018) . video of the presentation and slides analyzing operational behavior of stateful protocol implementations for detecting semantic bugs with endadul hoque (purdue university), sze yiu chau (purdue university), cristina nita-rotaru (northeastern university), and ninghui li (purdue university) appeared in proceedings of the 47th ieee/ifip international conference on dependable systems and networks (dsn 2017) . symcerts: practical symbolic execution for exposing noncompliance in x.509 certificate validation implementations with sze yiu chau (purdue university), endadul hoque (purdue university), huangyi ge (purdue university), aniket kate (purdue university), cristina nita-rotaru (northeastern university), and ninghui li (purdue university) appeared in proceedings of the 38th ieee symposium on security and privacy (s&p 2017). video of the presentation errata cves assigned to some of the bugs we found in various ssl/tls libraries: cve-2017-1000415 (matrixssl) cve-2017-1000416 (axtls embedded ssl) cve-2017-1000417 (matrixssl) an empirical study of mnemonic sentence-based password generation strategies with weining yang, ninghui li, aiping xiong, and robert proctor appeared in the proceeding of 23rd acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs), 2016. on the security and usability of segment-based visual cryptographic authentication protocols with tianhao wang, huangyi ge, hemanta k. maji, and ninghui li appeared in the proceeding of 23rd acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs), 2016. equivalence-based security for querying encrypted databases: theory and application to privacy policy audits with deepak garg, limin jia, and anupam datta appeared in the proceeding of 22nd acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs), 2015. temporal mode-checking for runtime monitoring of privacy policies with limin jia, deepak garg, and anupam datta appeared in the proceedings of 26th international conference on computer aided verification (cav), 2014.
