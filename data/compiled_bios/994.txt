 LOURDES AGAPITO Department of Computer Science, University College London Home People Research Publications Contact Lourdes Agapito I hold the position of Professor of 3D Vision in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL). My research in Computer Vision has consistently focused on the inference of 3D information from the video acquired from a single moving camera. While my early research focused on static scenes, my attention soon turned to the much more challenging problem of estimating the 3D shape of non-rigid objects (Non-Rigid Structure from Motion, NR-SFM) or complex dynamic scenes where an unknown number of objects might be moving, possibly deforming, independently. My research group investigates all theoretical and practical aspects of NRSFM: deformable tracking; dense optical flow estimation and non-rigid video registration; 3D reconstruction of deformable and articulated structure and dense 3D modelling of non-rigid dynamic scenes. I have held an ERC Starting Grant funded by the European Research Council from 2008-2014. I am a member of the Vision and Imaging Science group and the Centre for Inverse Problems . RECENT NEWS January 2015: I am Program Chair for CVPR'16 . January 2015: I am hiring 1 Postdoc on my new EU grant. January 2015: I have 3 PhD studentships available on funded projects (only for UK/EU students) starting in May 2015. I am looking for outstanding candidates with an MSc in Computer Vision (distinction). December 2014: I have just returned from attending 3DV'14 in Tokyo. It was a great conference and a very rewarding experience to have been Program Chair with Martial Hebert and Hiroshi Kawasaki. September 2014: Our EU Horizon 2020 proposal Second Hands has been accepted for funding. This is a 5 year grant with Ocado Technology, EPFL, KIT and UniRoma to design and build a robot that will assist a human in maintenance tasks. My group will be doing the 3D visual perception for the robot. June 2014: We just returned from CVPR'14 where our oral paper Reconstructing Pascal VOC received a lot of attention. We have been invited to submit an extended version to the PAMI special issue on the best papers from CVPR'14. June 2014: Our paper "Video-Popup: Monocular 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes" has been accepted as an oral presentation to ECCV'14!

September 2012: My PhD student Marco Paladini has been awarded the 2011 BMVA Sullivan Prize for his PhD Thesis with title "Deformable and Articulated 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video Sequences". The Sullivan prize is awarded each year by the British Machine Vision Association to the best doctoral thesis submitted to a UK University, in the field of Computer Vision. August 2012: New papers accepted to ECCV'12 and ISMAR'12. April 2012: I have been invited to lecture at the International Computer Vision Summer School ICVSS 2012 this July in Sicily. April 2012: Opening (1 PhD studentship) - Starting Sept 2012. I am looking for an outstanding candidate to work on dense non-rigid and articulated 3D reconstruction from monocular video .
