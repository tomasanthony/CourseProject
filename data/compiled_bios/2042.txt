Purdue University Background I joined the Mathematics department at Davidson College in 2012 after completing my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University. I attended Purdue University as an undergraduate, graduating with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I teach across the computer science curriculum at Davidson, and look forward to supporting and expanding our course offerings in this area. My research interests span multiple areas of Artificial Intelligence, including automated planning, combinatorial search, and machine learning. I supervise student research projects and theses on related topics. In my free time, I practice with DUFF, Davidson's Ultimate Frisbee team, and engage in a variety of outdoor pursuits including cycling, hiking and nature photography.
