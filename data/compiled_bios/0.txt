Abdelzaher Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Urbana, IL 61801 Tel: (217) 265-6793 Fax: (217) 244-6500 I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, in 1999, under Professor Kang Shin . I was an Asistant Professor at the University of Virginia from August 1999 to August 2005. I then joined the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as an Associate Professor with tenure, where I became Full Professor in 2011. My interests lie primarily in systems, including operating systems, networking, sensor networks, distributed systems, and embedded real-time systems. I am especially interested in developing theory, architectural support, and computing abstractions for predictability in software systems, motivated by the increasing software complexity and the growing sources of non-determinism. Applications range from sensor networks to large-scale server farms, and from transportation systems to medicine. New in Navigation: Green GPS . Brief Biosketch .
