I have designed several protocols for highly available fault-tolerant systems and have also been involved in designing systems and database support for geographic information systems and collaborative environments. Recently, I have been especially interested in exploring efficient ways for retrieving data in a distributed library as well as content-based searching using multi-dimensional index structures. I am currently involved in several research projects including Alexandria for building a distributed digital library (not to be confused with the ancient library of Alexandria ), an NSF sponsered data summarization project Yangtze , and an NSF sponser project on leveraging advanced hardware for data stream managment Hardware .
