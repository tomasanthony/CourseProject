 Toggle navigation Mario Bergs About Projects Teaching Publications Blog Contact I am Mario Bergs. I spend most of my time conducting engineering research at Carnegie Mellon University, in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, where I am an Associate Professor. I am interested in making our built environment more operationally efficient and robust through the use of information technologies, so that it can better deal with future resource constraints and a changing environment. In other words, I am interested in providing buildings, and other man-made structures that support our urban environment, with the ability to sense, plan and act autonomously, just as many living organisms do. When I am not busy leading a research lab ( INFERLab ) or teaching , I am either traveling, scouring the Internet for new information or enjoying/creating arts. Feel free to browse through the other sections of this site if you are interested in learning more about myself or my work. Recent News Contact Information e-mail: marioberges@cmu.edu
