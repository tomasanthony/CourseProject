The project started in May 2016, and its aims are to explore new algorithms based on multiple random walks that are able to cope with complex data sets and networks. I am currently a Mercator Fellow of the project "Analysis of Discrete Load Balancing on Heterogeneous Networks" (ADLON) (with Tobias Friedrich, HPI Potsdam), funded by the German Research Council. From November 2014-October 2015, I was the principal investigator of the project "Random Walks on Massive Graphs" supported by the Isaac Newton Trust / University of Cambridge Early Career Support Scheme.
