Defects have historically played an essential role in classical electronic/optical devices. Now new nanoscale devices are being developed based on the quantum properties of defects. We are occupied with the following questions: What are the fundamental properties of a known defect state? Alternatively, by measuring the properties of an unknown state, can we identify it? How can the quantum properties of a defect be engineered and controlled? What new technologies can quantum properties of defects enable? What new capabilities can be realized through solid-state device integration of defects? Fundamental Properties of defects in semiconductor Integrated Photonics Sensing Undergraduate Research There are often open graduate and undergraduate research positions in the group. Interested students should contact Kai-Mei directly. Unfortunately, the group does not fund international undergraduate students seeking summer research experiences. Self-funded students are welcome to contact Kai-Mei . Current funding for these projects is provided by NSF-QIS , MURI-ARO , and NSF-MRSEC . Past funding was provided by NSF-QIS/PHY .
