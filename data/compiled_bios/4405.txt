Professor Chin is a Research Professor in BU CS where he directs LISP (Learning, Intelligence + Signal Processing) group. He is alsoChief Scientist at Systems & Technology Research (STR).Prior to joining STR, Peter was a Chief Scientist Decision Systems at Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA. Before that, he was a co-director of DSP group in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department atJohns Hopkins University and a Chief Scientist in Cyber Technology Branch at JHU/APL. Hes a visiting fellow of London Institute of Mathematical Sciences and has held visiting positions at Tufts University (CS), Harvard University (Center for Math & Applications) and MIT (AeroAstro). Hes currently an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems and conferencecochair of the annual SPIE/DSS Conferenceon Cyber Sensing. Since completing his PhD in differential geometric methods to understand Einsteinsfield equations, he has been passionate aboutdeveloping geometric and topological methods tolearn and understandinformation in general signals (neural, RF, images, videos, hyper-spectral, etc.), graphs (social networks, communication networks, etc.) and human interactions via game theory.Recently, he has been interested in developing sparse deepnetworks to extract information and developing intelligence from large data sets. Most of his research is being (and has been) supported by AFOSR, DARPA, NSF, ODNI, ONR, OSD, and others. Peter is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Duke University where he was a triple major in computer science, math and electrical engineering. He holdsaPhD in mathematics from MIT.
