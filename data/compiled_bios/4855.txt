 Andrew Gordon Wilson CV News Papers Talks Group Teaching Code I lead a machine learning group at Cornell where I advise students in ORIE, Computer Science, Statistics, and CAM. You can check out some of our work here . I also teach classes on Bayesian machine learning and information theory. I organized the NIPS 2017 symposium on Interpretable Machine Learning . I am interested in developing flexible, interpretable, and scalable machine learning models, often involving kernel learning, deep learning, and Gaussian processes. I am particularly excited about probabilistic approaches. My work has been applied to time series, vision, NLP, spatial statistics, public policy, medicine, and physics. Outside of work, I am a classical pianist who particularly enjoys Glenn Gould's playing of Bach. I can be reached at andrew@cornell.edu , and on Twitter @andrewgwils . Andrew Gordon Wilson Assistant Professor 235 Rhodes Hall Cornell University News I received an Amazon Research Award for "New Directions in Non-Convex Optimization for Deep Learning". Thank you for the support, Amazon! Check out our new code and group pages! Three new papers appearing at NIPS 2018! I am an Area Chair/SPC for AAAI 2018, AISTATS 2018, UAI 2018, NeurIPS 2018, AISTATS 2019, ICML 2019, UAI 2019, NeurIPS 2019. Upcoming talks: I am giving invited talks at CMStatistics 2017, MSR Cambridge, Cambridge University, UCL Gatsby, Banff International Research Centre (Interface of Statistics and Machine Learning) 2018, DALI 2018, and SIAM ALA (Applied Linear Algebra) 2018, Allerton 2018, and the Toronto Deep Learning Summer School! Thesis My thesis provides an introduction to probabilistic non-parametric model construction, Gaussian processes and kernel design, and a vision for scalable and automatic kernel learning, with ideas for future directions.
