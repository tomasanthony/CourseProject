 Emmanuel Agu : Professor Post Doctoral Researcher Opening!! I am currently a professor in the Computer Science Department at WPI after receiving my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst . My research interests are in the areas of mobile health, computer graphics including mobile graphics and rendering (real-time and photorealistic). . I am also interested in most areas of mobile computing Mobile Health: I am interested in researching and developing smartphone apps that patients with health ailments can use to better manage their conditions. Specifically, I am interested in machine learning using smartphone sensor data to detect various ailments including alcohol consumption from gait analysis, or inferring depression, loneliness and sedentary behaviors from smartphone usage patterns. I am also interested in using machine learning/computer vision techniques to analyze smartphone images for health assessment including analyzing patients' wounds to assess healing progress. Since 2011, I have been involved in the NSF-funded Sugar project to develop a mobile application for patients with advanced diabetes, which automatically analyzes the healing progress of their foot ulcers and helps them manage their condition at home. I have also been a co-Investigator on NIH-funded projects on obesity ( [RELAX] ) and substance (alcohol and drug) abuse. I am also the faculty director for the steering committee of the Health Delivery Institute Mobile Computing: I am interested in most areas of mobile and ubiquitous computing especially using smartphones. I have researched and developed a wide range of mobile applications including location-aware tour guides, location-aware security modules, and a mobile Emergency Medical Services (EMS) incident reporting application. I have worked on energy profiling of mobile applications ( [ PowerSpy ] and energy efficient techniques. Mobile Graphics: In mobile graphics, we have created and prototyped a programmable mobile graphics API called the Mobile Adaptive Distributed Graphics Framework (MADGRAF) in which a powerful server can assist a mobile device in rendering relatively complex 3D scenes by applying techniques such as polygon simplification, image-based techniques, rendering using various Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques and remote execution. Graphics Rendering: I am generally interested in global illumination techniques for realistic graphics rendering, both real time GI (shaders) and non-real time (ray tracing, photon mapping). I have researched and developed rendering models for realistic materials reflectance (BRDFs). Examples of realistic materials I have researched include interesting natural wavelength-dependent phenomena such as diffraction which produces the color streaks we observe when we look at a CD-ROM and interference which produces color in oil slicks and soap bubbles. I teach the undergraduate and graduate computer graphics, undergraduate computer networks class as well as a graduate seminars in computer graphics and mobile computing.
