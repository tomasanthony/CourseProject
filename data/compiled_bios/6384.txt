Prior to joining Rutgers, I did postdocs in the Cryptography Research Group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, in the Mathematics Department at Ruhr-University Bochum, (working with Eike Kiltz), and in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, (working with Mihir Bellare). Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech under the direction of Alexandra Boldyreva.
