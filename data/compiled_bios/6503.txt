Taylor Professor of Computer Science Director, NIH Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry It is impossible to imagine modern biology without computational ideas developed by bioinformatics pioneers in the last two decades. Today, computational molecular biology remains a wild frontier with still unexplored boundaries. Bioinformatics is often defined as applications of computers in biology . We respectfully disagree: reducing bioinformatics to applications of computers in biology diminishes the rich intellectual content of bioinformatics. Indeed, bioinformatics has become a part of modern biology and often dictates new fashions, enables new approaches, and drives further biological developments. Our lab is well equipped with the appropriate gear and ammunition to continue explorations of uncharted bioinformatics territories. Bioinformatics postdoctoral positions available NIH- and HHMI-funded postdoctoral positions are available in Pavel Pevzner's lab at the University of California at San Diego. Applicants should either have experience in bioinformatics or have strong background in theoretical computer science or combinatorics and burning desire to work in the field of bioinformatics.

The peptide sequencing problem is to derive the sequence of a peptide given its spectrum Next Generation DNA Sequencing Computational biologists have to assemble the entire genome from short fragments, a task not unlike assembling the book from millions of slips of paper. The problem is complicated by unavoidable experimental errors (ink splashes) Genome Rearrangements Every study of genome rearrangements involves solving a combinatorial "puzzle'' to find a series of rearrangements that transform one genome into another. We are trying to reconstruct rearrangements and to reveal the ancestral mammalian genome by studying human-mouse-cat comparative physical mapping data Pattern Discovery and Comparative Proteogenomics When William Legrand from Edgar Allan Poe's novel "The Gold-Bug" found a parchment written by the pirate Captain Kidd: 53& & $305) ) 6*; 4826) 4& .) 4& ) :806*; 48$8{60) ) 85; 1& ( ; :& *8$83( 88) 5*$; 46( 88 *96*?; 8) *& ( ; 485) ; 5*$2:*& ( ; 4956*2( 5*--4) 8{8*; 4069285) ; ) 6$8) 4& & ; 1( & 9; 48081; 8:8& 1; 4885; 4) 485$528806*81( & 9; 48; ( 88; 4( & ?34; 48) 4& ; 161; :188; & ?; his friend told him, In the News New drugs faster from natural compounds: A UC San Diego breakthrough Origin of Species: How a T.
