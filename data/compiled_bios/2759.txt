 Barbara Engelhardt Computer Science Department Center for Statistics and Machine Learning Princeton University Menu: Home Research Courses Publications Software People Contact All information regarding the Engelhardt Research Group at Princeton can be found at the BEEHIVE . Barbara Engelhardt develops statistical models and methods to study human genetic variation and its impact on genomic regulation, including gene expression and splicing, with the goal of identifying mechanisms of human disorders and diseases. Some of these projects include: Sparse factor analysis for estimating population structure, low-dimensional mapping of complex phenotypes, and gene expression analysis Statistical models for improving power to detect trans-expression quantitative trait loci Alternative splicing and its role in complex phenotypes Differential gene co-expression networks Genome-wide association studies for pharmacogenomic, metabolic, and cardiovascular phenotypes Prof. Engelhardt is a PI in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Prospective graduate students: If you are interested in working in my group at Princeton for your PhD, you must be admitted to a graduate program at Princeton University. 2015 Barbara Engelhardt The picture was taken in the Big Island of Hawaii in 2007 Design by Andreas Viklund
