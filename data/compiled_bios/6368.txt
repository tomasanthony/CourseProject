I received the diploma in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 1979, the MSE in Systems Engineering from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1980, and the M.Sc and Ph.D in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University, Princeton NJ, in 1983.During 1983-1986 I held a Junior Researcher position with INRIA, France, then a Researcher position (1988-1991) with the Computer Technology Institute of Patras, Greece. In 1991 I joined the Computer Engineering and Informatics department, University of Patras, Greece as Associate Professor and became Full Professor in 1996. From 2001 to 2004 I was with INRIA, France as Senior Researcher (research group leader) and during 2001-2007 I was also a Professor with the University of Thessaly, Greece. In 2007 I joined the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Greece where I hold the position of Full Professor (currently on leave of absence). From Fall 2017 I am with the Computer Science department, Rutgers University.In the past I held numerous appointments (financed by the hosting institutes) as Visiting Scholar and/or Adjunct Professor with Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, University of Maryland, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Southern California, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Rutgers University (Business School, CS and ECE).My interests include Sequential Detection, Statistical Signal Processing, Adaptive Algorithms and Machine Learning.From 2011 to 2014 I served as Associate Editor for Detection and Estimation and from 2016 to 2018 as inaugural Associate Editor for Sequential Methods for the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
