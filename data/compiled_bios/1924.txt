[News] More... Introduction I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine . Before coming to UCI, I received my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018. My research generally focuses on network and systems security. More specifically, my research interest includes software security, network protocol security, DNS system security, smartphone system security, CPS/IoT system security, access control system security, vulnerability discovery and analysis, side channel attack and defense. Most recently, my research focuses mainly on security problems in smart systems and IoT , e.g., smart home systems, smart transportation systems, and autonomous vehicle systems. The major theme of my research is to proactively address security challenges through systematic problem analysis and design, leveraging techniques such as static/dynamic program analysis, software testing, and network measurement. My research has developed such approaches to systematically discover, analyze, detect, and fix vulnerabilities in a wide range of important computer systems and components such as smartphone OSes, network protocols, DNS, GUI systems, access control systems, and very recently intelligent traffic signal control systems.
