Please provide CV, statements, supporting materials for a pre-application discussion.Recent Academic ServicesProgram Committee Associate Chair (AC), CSCW19, CHI'19,CSCW'18,CHI'16,CHI'15,CHI'14,CSCW'15,CSCW'13Program Committee Subcommittee Chair (SC),CHI'18,CHI'17Program Committee, IJCAI'18, IJCAI19Program Committee, Chinese CHI'18Steering Committee,CSCW(2015-2018)I am currently an Acting Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis. My broad research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on issues of collaboration and social interaction, such as computer-mediated communication, conversation support tools, crowdsourcing and human computation. I am an active member of the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)and social computing community.My approach toward HCI research and design focuses on identifying ways to integrate human and machine processing for problem solving and value creation. I engage both in system building and behavioral science research with the goal to bridge the socio-technical gap between the two sides.I also maintain a general interest in other interdisciplinary issues situated in the intersection between computing and behavioral and social sciences, including cultural differences and the implications to design, societal issues in the production and use of digital information, and STS studies of technological construction and use.Between 2012 and 2018, I created and directed the Collaborative and Social Computing Lab (CSC Lab) at the Department of Computer Science and the Institute of Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan(NTHU). I was tenured at the rank of Associate Professor at NTHU in 2017.I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Information Science, Cornell University (2008-2011) with emphasis on HCI and information systems. Prior to Cornell, I studied and conducted research at several institutes, including the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (2006-2008),Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica (2004-2006), National Taiwan Normal University (2006), and National Chengchi University (2002-2004).HCW .CC 3.0 BY SA .2013-2018
