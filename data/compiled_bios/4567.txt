He received his Ph.D. from Boston University in 2009. He was a postdoctoral research fellow at Schlumberger-Doll Research (SDR), where he worked on signal processing solution products for borehole acoustics. Aeron has several patents in acoustic signal processing and his proposed workflows are currently implemented in SDRs logging while drilling tools. In 2016, he received an NSF CAREER award. Aeron is currently a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). His research interests are in statistical signal processing, information theory, and optimal sampling and recovery for multidimensional signals and systems.
