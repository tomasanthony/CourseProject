CURRENT PROJECTs Virtual and Augmented Reality Dynamic Network visualization: Developing visual systems for interacting with biological networks across multiple layers of abstraction. Visual features and automatic visualizations: Adapting visual features to cluster and provide an meaningful overview of complex data. The effects of an instructional avatar's gestures on teaching foreign languages: The goal of this project is to determine the role instructional gesturing plays in second language acquisition. And more... RESEARCH INTERESTs Developing methods and tools for visual analytics - an integrated approach combining visualization, human factors and data analysis to derive insight from massive, dynamic, and ambiguous data.
