["Professor of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics and Physics and AstronomyEducation1983, Doctoral Degree, Physics, University of Cambridge1980, Bachelor's Degree, Physics, University of SussexBachelor's Degree, Physics, Cambridge University BiographyTony Levi joined the USC faculty in mid-1993 after working for 10 years at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey. He invented hot electron spectroscopy, discovered ballistic electron transport in heterostructure bipolar transistors, demonstrated room temperature operation of unipolar transistors with ballistic electron transport, created the first microdisk laser, and carried out work in parallel fiber optic interconnect components in computer and switching systems. His current research interests include high-performance electronic and photonic systems, RF photonics, very small lasers and modeling their behavior, optimal design of small electronic and photonic systems, and coherent control of transient dynamics. To date he has published numerous scientific papers, several book chapters, is author of the books Applied Quantum Mechanics,  Essential Classical Mechanics for Device Physics, Essential Semiconductor Laser Device Physics, coeditor of the book Optimal Device Design, and holds 17 U.S. patents.Research SummaryDr. Levi's current research projects include Adaptive Quantum Design, Microdisk lasers, Microphotonic RF receiver and Fiber-to-the-processorAppointmentsDepartment Chair, Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering-ElectrophysicsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - ElectrophysicsPhysics and Astronomy OfficeKAP 132Kaprielian Hall3620 South Vermont Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2533 Contact Information(213) 740-7318alevi@usc.eduWebsitesResearch Website"]
