China, 1996 B.Eng. from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, P.R. China, 1993 Background Since joining UTK faculty in August 2004, Dr. Wu has been developing a research program, electromechanics for nanobiotechnology, and establishing national and international prominence of UTK in the field. She has received the NSF Career Award, ORAU Junior Faculty Award, Science Alliance and other grants to support this research program. Within two years, the program has expanded to seven graduate students (four PhD students). The group, aiming to lead and emphasizing on innovation, has produced several of the worlds first microfluidic devices, a first electrokinetic (EK) micropump for bio/ conductive fluids, a first in-situ particle trap on microcantilevers, a biased AC electro-osmotic micropump, with more inventions being developed, as well as industrial interest in SBIR/STTR. Two pending patents, one provisional patent and one disclosure have been filed through UTRF. UTKs pioneering contribution in this field is being recognized by the peers all over the world, and Dr. Wu has been frequently solicited for seminars on her electrokinetic research at UTK, both nationally and internationally.
