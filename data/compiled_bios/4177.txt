Michael's primary research interests are in machine learning, probabilistic artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory, and computational finance. He integrates problems from these areas with methods from theoretical computer science and related disciplines. While the majority of Michael's work is mathematical in nature, he has also participated in a variety of systems and experimental work, including spoken dialogue systems, software agents, and most recently, human-subject experiments in strategic and economic interaction.
