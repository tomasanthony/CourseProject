Jennifer W. Graham Assistant Teaching Professor, BSCE and BSEE Program Director Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-179 CST 315.443.4416 [email&#160;protected] Electromagnetic, complex media, antenna design and modeling Education: B.S.E.E Syracuse University, 2000 M.S.E.E. Syracuse University, 2004 Ph.D. Syracuse University, 2012 Current Research: My current research includes understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex media specifically anisotropic media. I have studied biaxially anistropic media with the most depth including wave propagation and reflection and transmission. I also have research interest in antennas including antenna modeling and measurement. I have combined research areas by modeling microstrip antennas printed on biaxially anisotropic substrates.
