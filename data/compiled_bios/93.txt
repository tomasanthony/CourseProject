David C. Bell is Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Electron Microscopy at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and also manages the imaging and analysis facility at Harvard University's Center for Nanoscale Systems. Bell received his doctorate in physics from University of Melbourne, and did his postdoctoral study at MIT. His research focuses on nanocomposite materials' properties and applications for optical and structural uses, theory and applications of aberration-corrected analytical electron microscopy of nano-materials, and charged particle beam lithography using high-energy electrons and ions for fabrication and modification of nanoscale devices. He has authored numerous publications and books and is on editorial boards of several materials and microscopy journals. Bell is a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society UK.
