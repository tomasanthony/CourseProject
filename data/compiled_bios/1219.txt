 Alexandre Brandwajn Professor Computer Engineering Research areas Performance modeling, queuing network models of computer systems and networks, computer architecture and operating systems Current research interests Efficient solution of systems with large state space Application of conditional probability in the solution of performance models Stable recurrent solutions Models of virtualized systems I/O subsystem models, optical channels Multimedia/networking problems, e.g. optical networks Efficient solutions of priority system Credentials B.A. (University of Paris IV Sorbonne), Docteur-Ingnieur, Docteur d'Etat (University of Paris VI -UPMC) Ingnieur Civil des Tlcommunications (ENST, Paris) Biography I started my research by designing and implementing a load simulator for the ESOPE Operating System within the operating system research group at I(n)RIA, the French national research center. Next, I worked on modeling the performance of virtual memory systems, and, in particular, on the determination of the optimal multiprogramming degree. During this work I started to build a general framework for the equivalence and decomposition method which relies on the use of marginal and conditional state probabilities. This method allows to obtain (in general, approximate) solutions of complex systems through structured decomposition. During my tenure at the Computer Science department at the ENST in Paris, I formed a research team in adaptive system architectures. Among the goals of the project was the dynamic adaptation of the architecture to changes in load and to component failures. The resulting dynamic reconfiguration was to allow the addition or removal of system components and devices without the need to stop and reboot the system, well before "plug and play" systems became a commercial reality. Later, I joined a large computer manufacturer in the Silicon Valley (Amdahl Corporation) where I worked on the performance modeling of transaction processing systems, large enterprise systems, storage subsystems, as well as on modeling network performance. The latter resulted in my work (with L. Jow) on tandem queueing networks with blocking. My work in industry was instrumental in allowing me to develop an appreciation forthe "real world", problems in model calibration, and, in general, the size of realistic problems. As a professor of Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz, my research topics have included solution method for large systems, multi-server priority queues, multicast systems with periodic synchronization and the modeling of optical networks (during my sabbatical at Telecom Sud Paris). Additionally, I have continued my work on model calibration. Some of the ideas of that researchled to the PhD work of Thomas Begin at the University of Paris (UPMC), which incorporated the idea of automated model calibration and selection. At the same time, I have continued my work on the use of conditional probabilities in the solution of queueing models. This idea resulted inthe development of numerically stable efficient recurrent solution of M/Ph/1 -like queues, and more recently, to the development of an efficient iterative solution for the Ph/Ph/c queue. I continue to be interested inapproaches that allow circumventing the combinatorial explosion of the size of the state space, in particular, in the context of virtualized systems and "cloud computing".

Recent Sabbatical Leaves April June 2010 I spent my Spring 2010 sabbatical at the LIP Laboratory of the Ecole Normale Suprieure de Lyon continuing my joint work with Dr. Thomas Begin on efficient solutions of general queues, as well as collaborating with colleagues (Professors Paolo Gonalves and Isabelle Gurin Lassous) and graduate students on topics related to modeling TCP performance and on static versus dynamic network routing protocols. The work on these topics is still under way. During my stay in Lyon, I gave a seminar on my current research interests. I was also the Chair of the doctoral defense committee for Dinil Mon Divakaran (Dealing with Elephants in the Internet: Towards a Flow-Based Internet Architecture). January-March 2011 I spent my Winter 2011 sabbatical in Paris dividing my time between the Ecole Nationale Suprieure des Tlcommunications (ENST) and the LIP6 laboratory at the University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI). My main research during this period was in the area of applicability of state sampling to the solution of models of large dimension (ENST with Dr. Thomas Bonald), as well as automated model generation and calibration (LIP6 with Prof. Serge Fdida). During my stay in Paris, I gave an invited talk at the LINCS Institute in Paris on possible approaches to cicumvent the intrinsic complexity of standard queueing network solutions. The work on state sampling expands my previous work on fast solutions with partial state evaluation in computer and network models. The question addressed here was the applicability of this method to networks with strong coupling for which an exact product-form solution exists but is costly to compute. The preliminary results seem encouraging at least for some classes of models. The results obtained will become the subject of a future paper. The work on automatic model generation and calibration was an attempt to apply methods developed previously during the Ph. D. work of Thomas Begin to the modeling of the behavior of wireless networks. This work is still ongoing Classes taught recently Probability and statistics for engineers (upper division undergraduate) Computer architecture (upper division undergraduate) Performance evaluation (graduate) Advanced topics in performance evaluation (graduate) Network engineering project (graduate capstone).
