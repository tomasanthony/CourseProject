Peter Steenkiste Professor of Computer Science And Electrical And Computer Engineering Office: 9107 Gates & Hillman Centers Email: prs@cs.cmu.edu Department:Computer Science Department Electrical & Computer EngineeringWeb site:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs Administrative Support Person: Angela MalloyResearch Interests: Distributed SystemsMobile and Pervasive ComputingNetworkingSecurity and PrivacyMy research interests are broadly speaking in computer networking and distributed systems. My research is very applied: we build prototype systems that incorporate our research ideas and we evaluate these systems using real applications in a realistic setting. I currently have active research projects in the following areas:Future Internet Architecture The architecture of todays Internet is more than 30 years old. Of course, the network has changed significantly in terms of scale, technologies, applications, and traffic. An interesting research question is whether we can define a new network architecture that will not only better support todays Internet, but that can also better support future changes in technology and usage. We have proposed a new architecture, called the eXpressive Internet Architecture or XIA. Within the context of XIA and today's Internet, we are now explore a wide range of networking research topics including congestion control, mobility, network diagnostics, and routing.Wireless Networking Wireless networks have become ubiquitous and most of us use a variety of wireless technologies on a daily if not hourly basis. This rapid growth in usage and deployment, combined with the emergence of new technologies such as smart antennas and software radios, has made wireless an incredibly exciting research area. The wireless networking projects I am involved in cover a wide range of topics including self-managing and self-optimizing wireless deployments, dynamic spectrum access, and vehicular networks.
