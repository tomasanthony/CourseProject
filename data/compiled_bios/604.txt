 Eytan Adar I am an Associate Professor of Information and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. My work is at the boundary of HCI and Data Mining. Specific research projects range from modeling behaviors at a very large-scale (search, social networks evolution, learning, meme and rumor spread, programming, text production and consumption, etc.) and applying those models to constructing better HCI systems. This is primarily at Internet scales and it gives me an excuse to work on lots of different things I like... data/text mining, visualizations, social network analysis, etc. Before grad school I was a researcher at HP Labs' Information Dynamics Group and at Xerox PARC. (complete CV). Among other things, I am associated with the MISC (HCI-focused) and MIDAS groups. I am one of the founders of ICWSM (which I've chaired multiple times) and have also been Co-General Chair for WSDM. Work in my group is sponsored by the NSF, IARPA, Adobe, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. I work with some awesome students including: Aria Collopy, Srayan Datta, Licia He, and Hari Subramonyam. And some that recently graduated: Matt Burgess (PhD, now at Google), Jessica Hullman (Assistant Professor at UW), Gierad Laput (PhD at CMU), and Xin Rong. I have a blog (which I post to pretty infrequently). Some demos/videos of other recent work for you to try: PersaLog (news content personalization); Txt2Vis (including the Contextifier and NewsViews projects for generating visualizations automatically); CodeMend (natural language code assistant), DataTone (natural language-driven vis construction); PixelTone (voice and gesture for photo editing); TappCloud (Photoshop in the cloud); Zoetrope (querying the ephemeral Web); GUESS, the Graph Exploration System; Other videos on YouTube (click on "watch in high quality" for a better view); and More...
