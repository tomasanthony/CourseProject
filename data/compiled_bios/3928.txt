Lee Bioplasmonics Group Professor Somin Eunice Lee PRECISION BIOTECHNOLOGIES via PLASMONICS The Bioplasmonics Group @ Michigan focuses on developing precision technologies to improve human health. We develop new spatially and temporally resolved technologies for imaging and control within single cells beyond the diffraction limit. We envision that high resolution combined with high-throughput omics (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) will revolutionize precision medicine and health.
