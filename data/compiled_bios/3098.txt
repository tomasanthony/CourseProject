Spring 2019 Teaching Schedule Office hours TW 1:30 - 3:30pm SCI 243 CS63: Artificial Intelligence Class MWF 11:30 - 12:20 SCI 181 Lab A R 1:05 - 2:35pm Clothier Lab B R 2:45 - 4:15pm Clothier Research My current research is in the field of developmental robotics where the goal is to create intelligent robots by allowing them to go through a developmental process, rather than being directly programmed to solve a particular task. By endowing a robot with an appropriate control architecture and adaptive mechanisms, it can learn through interactions with the world, developing its own knowledge about itself and its environment.
