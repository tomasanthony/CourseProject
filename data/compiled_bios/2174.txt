Langlais, Philippe	Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. Challenges in NLP are numerous and enrol various components from morphological analyzers to semantic parsers. The core of my scientific activity consists in studying data-driven methods, notably but not only machine learning, in order to model linguistic knowledge as well as to develop NLP applications. The latest applications I have been working on are automatic and machine-aided translation, and unsupervised morphology acquisition.
