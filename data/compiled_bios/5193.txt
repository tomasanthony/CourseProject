California Blvd. CMS, 305-16 Pasadena, CA 91125 Office: 303 Annenberg Email: yyue@caltech.edu ( please read before emailing ) Admin: Diane Goodfellow ( diane@cms.caltech.edu ) About I am an assistant professor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institute of Technology . I am the director of the DOLCIT , which is broadly centered around research pertaining statistical decision theory, statistical machine learning, and optimization. more > Postdoc Openings We are soliciting postdoc applications for the DOLCIT Postdoctoral Fellowship Program . Ideal candidates should have broad interests in machine learning. Our research interests span the entire spectrum of theoretical and applied machine learning. We have numerous collaborations with the sciences and engineering. New PhD Program Prospective PhD Students, please consider applying to Caltech's new PhD program in Computing and Mathematical Sciences . I also recruit from the PhD program in Computation & Neural Systems . info for prospective students & postdocs > Research My research interests lie primarily in the theory and application of statistical machine learning . I am more generally interested in artificial intelligence . I am the director of DOLCIT , and I also interact closely with the RSRG and Computational Vision groups at Caltech, as well as the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technology (CAST) and the Center for the Mathematics of Information (CMI) . My research interests lie primarily in the theory and application of statistical machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing novel methods for interactive machine learning and structured machine learning. In the past, my research has been applied to information retrieval, recommender systems, text classification, learning from rich user interfaces, analyzing implicit human feedback, data-driven animation, behavior analysis, sports analytics, experiment design for science, policy learning in robotics, and adaptive planning & allocation problems. more > Selected Recent Publications & Preprints: Detecting Adversarial Examples via Neural Fingerprinting Sumanth Dathathri, Stephan Zheng, Yisong Yue, Richard M.
