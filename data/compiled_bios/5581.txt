 Toggle navigation James Caverlee Home Publications Students Teaching Service Awards James Caverlee Associate Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering Texas A&M University infolab [my_last_name] 'at' cse.tamu.edu Teaching Spring 2019: CSCE 670, Information Storage and Retrieval My research targets topics from recommender systems, social media, information retrieval, data mining, emerging networked information systems, and occasional forays into distributed systems and services computing. I usually wear one of two hats in my work: For many years, I have studied threats to these systems, including social spam/bots [ ICWSM2011 , SIGIR2010 ], crowd-powered strategic manipulation [ SIGIR2015 , WSDM2018 ], collective attention threats [ ICWSM2013 ], attacks on search engines [ PODC 2007 ], and other emerging threats [ CIKM2016 ]. I'm also very interested in creating new beneficial algorithms and frameworks for these systems, including our work on geo-social characteristics of social media [ WWW2013 , ICWSM2011 ], user modeling [ SIGIR2018 , RecSys 2016 ], expert detection [ RecSys2016 , SIGIR2014 ], and geo-inferencing [ CIKM2010 ]. My research approach is primarily data-driven and experimental in nature. About me: I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2007, co-advised by Ling Liu (CS) and Bill Rouse (ISYE). Before that, I earned two M.S. degrees from Stanford University: one in Computer Science in 2001 and one in Engineering-Economic Systems & Operations Research in 2000. My undergraduate degree is a B.A. in Economics (magna cum laude) from Duke University in 1996. I joined the faculty at Texas A&M in 2007. I spent most of my sabbatical in 2015 at Google as a Visiting Scientist in Ed Chi's group. I've been honored to receive an NSF CAREER award, DARPA Young Faculty award, a AFOSR Young Investigator award, as well as several teaching awards.
