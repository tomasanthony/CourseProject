Professor , Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty-Affiliate , Calit2 Information coding and data compression, information theory, and signal processing, including image and speech processing. Professor Zeger works on coding for a variety of applications, including: telephony, imaging, networking, and electronic devices. His work on information coding includes source and channel coding, as well as speech and image processing. Zeger's research has focused on compression, pattern recognition, communication protocols, and computational complexity theory. In particular he has examined joint source-channel coding for circuit switched and packet switched networks. Capsule Bio: Kenneth Zeger received both S.B. and S.M. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT in 1984, and both an M.A. degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at UCSB, in 1989 and 1990, respectively. He was Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Hawaii 1990-1992. He was in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as Assistant Professor 1992-1995, and as Associate Professor 1995-1996. He has been in the ECE Department at UCSD, as Associate Professor 1996-1998, and as Professor 1998-present. He received an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1991. He served as Associate Editor At-Large for the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 1995-1998, served as a member of the Board of Governors of the IEEE Information Theory Society 1998-2000 and 2005-2007, and is an IEEE Fellow.
