 I am a Professor of Computer Science & Engineering and an Adjunct Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington . My research group is Computational & Synthetic Biology . My research interests are in computational molecular biology, with emphases on biological sequence analysis, regulatory analysis, and comparative genomics. Some of my lecture notes and published research articles are available online. Brief biography: I graduated from Harvard University in 1974 and received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 1978. For the next 7 years I was here, on the Computer Science faculty at the University of Washington, where I received a Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1984, the inaugural year for these awards. From 1985 to 1989 I was on the staff of the IBM Research Division at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center and became manager of its Theory of Computation group. In 1989, I rejoined the Computer Science faculty at UW, and in 1998 and 1999 I received the first two annual ACM Undergraduate Teaching Awards. In 2001 I became Adjunct Professor of Genome Sciences, and from 2009 to 2013 I was Director of the UW's interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Computational Molecular Biology .
