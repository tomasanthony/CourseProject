Brief Bio Dr. Jiao received his B.S. in 1995 from Peking University , China, his M.S. in 1997 from University of California Santa Barbara , and his Ph.D. in computer science in 2001 from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). After working in interdisciplinary research for a few years as a Research Scientist at the Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets (CSAR) at UIUC and then an Assistant Professor in College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology , he joined the faculty of Stony Brook University in Fall 2007. He is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics and is affiliated with the Computer Science Department and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science . Research Dr. Jiao's research interests are in high-performance geometric and numerical computing in science and engineering. His work focuses on developing efficient and robust algorithms and high-performance software implementations for applied computational and differential geometry, generalized finite difference and finite element methods, multigrid and iterative methods for sparse linear systems, and multiphysics coupling, with applications in computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, biomedical engineering, climate modeling, etc. Teaching Current Teaching AMS 527: Numerical Analysis II Spring 2019 AMS 561: Introduction to Computational Science Spring 2019 Past Teachings AMS 501: Differential Equations and BVPs I (Ordinary Differential Equations) Fall 10-11 AMS 526: Numerical Analysis I (Numerical Linear Algebra) Fall 07-12,14-16,18 AMS 527: Numerical Analysis II Spring 09-16 AMS 529/691: Finite Element Methods: Fundamentals and Applications Fall 2017 AMS 595/691: Fundamentals of Computing Fall 16-18 AMS 561: Introduction to Computational Science Spring 17-18 AMS 261: Applied Calculus III (Multivariable Calculus) Spring 09-13 & Fall 09,12 AMS 691.3: Topics in Computational Mathematics Spring 08 CS 8803-MS: Introduction to Modeling and Simulation (GaTech) Spring 07 CS 3240: Languages and Computation (GaTech) Summer & Fall 06 CS 3510: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (GaTech) Spring 06 Awards Excellence in Teaching, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, Fall 2016-2017, Spring 2018 Outstanding Teacher Award, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, Fall 2010-2012, Spring 2013-2014.
