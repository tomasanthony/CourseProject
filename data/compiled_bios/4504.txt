[Paper] Teaching I've guest lectured on Internet Freedom for Vern Paxson's undergraduate security course and Malware for David Wagner's. Spring 2013 I was a GSI for CS161 with Vern Paxson, for which I was awarded the CS Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award . My evaluation results are available here . During Summer 2010 I was the instructor for CS61C, a sophomore level CS class here at UC Berkeley. The course website complete with lectures etc is here . You can find my student evaluation results here . I was a GSI also for CS61C during Summer 2009 . From Fall 2009 through Spring 2010 I was a member of the UC Berkeley EECS Undergraduate Study Committee . Distinctions 2014 CS Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award . NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Honorable Mention, Operating Systems and Middleware, 2011 . UC Berkeley Eugene L. Lawler Prize . UC Berkeley Fong Family Award . Life I am an avid Cal Football fanatic. I've bowled since I was 9, and carry an average in the 180s (high game is 289, darn 10 pin). While an undergraduate I initiated at the Mu Chapter of Eta Kappa Nu , the national EECS honor society. I am a proud product of the California Community College system, having attended both Chaffey and Mount San Antonio colleges. New! I'm now really into aquariums. PowerPoint source to my slides are available upon request.
