For a while now, Sasha Rakhlin and I have been working on our book ''Statistical Learning and Sequential Prediction''. Next semester I will be offering my Machine Learning Theory (CS6783) course again. About Me: I am currently an assistant Professor at the department of Computer Science at Cornell University. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Pennsylvania, jointly with Alexander Rakhlin and Michael Kearns. I obtained my PhD from Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago where my thesis advisor was Nathan Srebro . My primary area of research is theoretical machine learning.
