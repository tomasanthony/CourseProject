 Kunal Agrawal Associate Professor Lab Website Research KunalAgrawal is interested in many aspects of parallel computing and works primarily on design of provably good runtime systems for parallel programming environments. She has worked on various topics such as scheduling, resource allocation, transactional memory, cache-aware, and cache-oblivious streaming. Biography In 2009, Professor Agrawal joined the Washington University in St. Louis faculty aftershe worked with Professor Charles Leiserson in the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologySupercomputing Technologies Group. The goal of her 2012 National Science Foundation CAREER Award, "Provably Good Concurrency Platforms for Streaming Applications," is to design platforms that will allow programmers to easily write correct and efficient high-throughput parallel programs.: . . . 314-935-4838 kunal@wustl.edu JolleyHall, Room 514. .
