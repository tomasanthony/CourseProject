Mark Richard Floryan Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. University of Virginia, 2008M.S. University of Massachusetts, 2010Ph.D. University of Massachusetts, 2013 "I study the ways in which artificial intelligence, games, and other sub-areas of computing can improve education for all." Mark Richard Floryan, Lecturer I focus on computer science education and the ways in which computing can improve education more generally. I teach core computer science courses (e.g., Data Structures, Algorithms) as well as electives related to my field (e.g., Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, HCI). As a researcher, I strive to get undergraduate students involved in research activities and to continue to investigate the ways in which games, artificial intelligence, and human centered design can create more personalized educational experiences for all.
