News of Robotics and Multiperception Lab Last modified on Fri, Jul 21, 2017 MISSION Our mission and dedication are to create intelligent systems that can autonomously operate in a complex and diverse environment, with multiple perception approaches. We are fascinated by novel robot concepts that are best adapted for acting with large-scale and dynamic environments and different terrains. We are furthermore keen to give them the intelligence to autonomously navigate in challenging environments. This includes novel methods and tools for human-robot interaction, perception, cognition, knowledge abstraction, mapping, learning, representation, planning, and execution.
