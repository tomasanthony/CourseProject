Huili Grace Xing William L. Quackenbush Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 425 607/255-0605 William L. Quackenbush Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Materials Science and Engineering grace.xing@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Huili (Grace) Xing is theRichard E. Lunquist Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow, Professor at Cornell University where she holds a joint appointment in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Xing received a Bachelor Degree in Physics from Peking University. After that, she pursued a Master Degree in Material Science and Engineering at Lehigh University. Wanting to work with devices that use wonderful material properties, she went to the University of California at Santa Barbara for her Ph.D. and eventually earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. From 2004 to 2014 she was a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame. Xing joined Cornell in 2015.. Research Interests Xing's research work can be loosely categorized into 4 areas, supported by DoD, NSF, SRC and Doe. GaN based devices. The current projects include GaN power diodes and transistors, AlN/GaN ultrascaled high electron mobility transistors for high-speed high power applications, polarization doping for p-type in UV optoelectronic devices, negative differential resistance and plasma based THz sources for biomedical imaging and spectroscopy, wafer fused enabled hybrid structures. Nanowire enabled devices, including InGaN nanowires for high efficiency green emission and solar cells, II-VI nanowires for polarization sensitive wide spectrum photodetection etc. 2D crystal materials and devices. We investigate van der Waals epitaxy, carrier electrostatics and transport, optoelectronic responses, p-n junctions and heterostructures, field modulation and tunneling, metamaterials and THz applications, graphene physics and devices. We investigate graphene based metamaterials for THz applications, lateral bandgap engineering in graphene, carrier electrostatics and transport, and optoelectronic responses, p-n junctions, field modulation and tunneling phenomena. Steep slope transistors for high-efficiency logic and RF electronics, especially tunnel FETs. We pioneered design, fabrication and characterization of III-V TFETs. Our current focus is 2D-crystal based steep slope transistors: the Thin-TFETs, tunneling field effect transistors for high efficiency logic electronics.
