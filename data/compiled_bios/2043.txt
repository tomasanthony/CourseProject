University of North Carolina at Charlotte M.S., M.S. Georgia Institute of Technology B.S. St. Mary's University Background My teaching interests include computer science and my research interests include computer science education, recommender systems, and data mining. I am also learning my way into Makerspace projects using my Raspberry Pi and programmable mini-drones. Before coming to Davidson, I served as a staff researcher at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte working on a data science Learning Analytics project in the College of Computing and Informatics. Prior to obtaining my Ph.D., I enjoyed a successful career in software development as well as software development and services delivery management, primarily in the finance industry and in government-funded research and development software and hardware development. I began my software development and management career working at Georgia Tech Research Institute for six years, then 26 years at IBM Corporation, and two years as a private consultant at a Fortune 50 banking institution. I am a PMI-certified project management professional. Research For my doctoral research in computing and information systems I focused on the study of attacks on recommender systems. My recommender system work has been published and presented at various stateside and international conferences such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Recommender Systems; User Modeling, Adaption, and Personalization (UMAP); and Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society (FLAIRS). As a Ph.D. student at UNCC, I received the 2014-15 Giles Dissertation-Year Fellowship award from the graduate school and the 2011 Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award from the College of Computing and Informatics. I also co-authored (with Celine Latulipe and N. Bruce Long) the paper "Structuring Flipped Classes with Lightweight Teams and Gamification" that won the Best Paper award at the 2015 ACM SigCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education.
