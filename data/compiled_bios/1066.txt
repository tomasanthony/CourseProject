 Sarah Meiklejohn About Me Bio I am a Reader (Associate Professor) in Cryptography and Security at UCL, in the Computer Science department. I am affiliated with the Information Security Group , and am also a member of the Open Music Initiative and the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) . Before joining UCL, I received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego under the joint supervision of Mihir Bellare and Stefan Savage . During my PhD, I spent the summers of 2011 and 2013 at MSR Redmond, working in the cryptography group with Melissa Chase . I obtained an Sc.M. in Computer Science from Brown University under the guidance of Anna Lysyanskaya in 2009, and an Sc.B. in Mathematics from Brown in 2008.
