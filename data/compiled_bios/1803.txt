 Shandian Zhe Assistant Professor School of Computing , University of Utah Office: Room 3466, MEB building Address: 50 Central Campus Dr #2110, School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 I obtained the Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department of Purdue University in 2017. My research interests mainly lie in probabilistic machine learning (and its various applications). That is, using probabilistic frameworks to formulate learning problems and to infer/estimate model parameters. My research include but are not limited to probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian nonparametric, approximate inference, Bayesian deep learning, sparse learning, large-scale machine learning and kernel methods. From application side, I have developed probabilistic methods for microarray data analysis, association study for Alzheimer's disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis, and click-through-rate prediction for online advertising. Email: zhe at cs.utah.edu Curriculum Vitae I am looking for highly motivated students with solid background in probability, linear algebra and/or optimization, and good programming skills. If you are interested in joining my group, welcome to contact me via the email address above. Please attach your CV in the email.
