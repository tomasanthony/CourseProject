Chick Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, where he also holds appointments in vision science, cognitive science and Bioengineering. He received the PhD degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1985 following which he joined UC Berkeley as a faculty member. He served as Chair of the Computer Science Division during 2002-2006, and of the Department of EECS during 2004-2006. Jitendra's group has worked on computer vision, computational modeling of biological vision, computer graphics and machine learning. Several well-known concepts and algorithms arose in this work, such as anisotropic diffusion, normalized cuts, high dynamic range imaging and shape contexts. He was awarded the Longuet-Higgins Award for A Contribution that has Stood the Test of Time twice, in 2007 and 2008, received the PAMI Distinguished Researcher Award in computer vision in 2013 the K.S. Fu prize in 2014, and the IEEE PAMI Helmholtz prize for two different papers in 2015. Jitendra Malik is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. .
