I received my B.Sc. (2007), M.Sc. (2009), and Ph.D. (2014) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete (Greece) while working as a research assistant in the Distributed Computing Systems Lab at FORTH. Prior to joining UIC, I was a postdoctoral research scientist in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University , and a member of the Network Security Lab. More information is available in my resume . Research: My research interests span several areas of security and privacy . In the past few years I have focused on understanding the security limitations of online social networks and web services, exploring the privacy threats that users face, and designing robust countermeasures . Im also interested in the shortcomings of authentication mechanisms and the robustness of bot-prevention mechanisms. Ultimately my research focuses on better understanding the Webs threat landscape and securing users.
