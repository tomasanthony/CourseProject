James Richard Shealy Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 311 607/255-4657 jrs27@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography After earning his doctorate, Shealy held a dual appointment at Cornell as a research associate and at General Electric as a principal staff scientist. ln 1983 he co-founded, and has chaired, the biennial international workshop on OMVPE (organometallic vapor phase epitaxy), a technique used for growing semiconductor crystals. He joined the faculty in 1987 and is active in developing Cornell's laboratory research in compound semiconductor materials and related graduate courses. At Cornell he is associated with thc National Nanofabrication Facility, Joint Services Electronics Program, and the DARPA Optoelectronics Technology Center.. Research Interests Compound Semiconductor Materials for Ultra-High-Speed Transistors (Joint Services Electronics Program) Advanced Crystal-Growth Techniques for New Semiconductors Using OMVPE (Strategic Defense Initiative Organization-lnnovative Science and Technology) Selective Deposiion of Optoelectronic Materials with OMVPE (DARPA Optoelectronic Materials Center) Semiconductor Physics and Devices Solid State, Electronics, Optoelectronics and MEMs. Teaching Interests Silicon Device Fundamentals, Micro theory Devices and applications.
