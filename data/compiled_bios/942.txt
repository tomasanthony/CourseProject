 David J Fleet Professor Department of Computer Science University of Toronto and Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences University of Toronto Scarborough Senior Fellow Canadian Institue for Advanced Research Faculty Member Vector Institute Research I am Professor of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. In addition to my appointment at the university, I am a Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and a Faculty Member of the Vector Institute . I joined the University of Toronto in October, 2003. Prior to that I worked in the Digital Video Analysis and Perceptual Document Analysis Groups at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) for 4 years. Before that I was on faculty at Queen's University in Kingston. During 2013-2018 I served as Chair of the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I served as Associate Editor (2000-2003) and then as Associate Editor-in-Chief (2004-2008) for IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI). I also served as Program Co-Chair of IEEE CVPR (2003), ECCV (2014), and as Area Chair for numerous vision and learning conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NIPS, ICML). At present I serve on the Advisory Board for IEEE PAMI. My research interests include aspects of computer vision, machine learning, image processing, and visual neuroscience. Most of my specific research in vision and image analysis has focused on mathematical foundations and algorithms for visual motion analysis and stereopsis, tracking, human pose and motion estimation, video classification/captioning, and more recently 3D reconstruction for electron cryo-microscopy. My research in machine learning has focused on discrete and continuous latent variable models for human pose and motion and large scale data indexing and retrieval.
