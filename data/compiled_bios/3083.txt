 Hae Young Noh Log in Home Research Publications Teaching Professional Activities People Search Welcome Hae Young Noh is an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering with a courtesy appointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Noh's research interests focusonindirect sensing to infer information about dynamic structural systems using statistical signal processing and machine learning techniques, particularly algorithm development for smart structures and systems to conserve energy and resources, provide safe, functional, and sustainable environments, and improve occupants quality of life. Currently, herresearch projects include human and environment sensing through building vibration andvehicle-based infrastructure monitoring.
