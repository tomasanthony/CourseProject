 Andrew Danner Associate Professor Computer Science Swarthmore College Swarthmore, PA 19081 Science Center 247 CV | Papers | Lidar | Watersheds Other: TerraSTREAM / SCALGO | TPIE | GRASS | Weather I/O-Efficient Algorithms and GIS Applications Welcome I'm an associate professor in computer science at Swarthmore College . I am interested in researching ways to process very large geometric data sets that often arise in geographic information systems (GIS). I am originally from Southwestern Pennsylvania , so I say " pop ", not "soda".

On data sets larger than the amount of available internal memory of a computer, the transfer of data between slow hard disks and faster internal memory, not CPU speed, limits computing performance. Working in a theoretical model that mimics this behavior, I am interested in finding efficient ways to solve problems in computational geometry on large data sets. I also look at possible applications in geographic information systems (GIS). The STREAM project page summarizes some recent contributions by my research group to hi-resolution elevation data analysis and modeling. While my emphasis is on theory, I prefer to develop solutions that are practical enough to implement and be applied. One example of a practical project that I work on is TPIE a templated, portable I/O environment written in C++ that makes it easier for people to develop I/O-efficient applications. I also contribute to the open source GIS community through the GRASS project. Publications T. Newhall and A. Danner. Fire Simulator and Fractals: using a visualization library to introduce CUDA.
