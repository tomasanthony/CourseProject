Hongwei Xi received his Ph.D. degree in the field of Pure and Applied Logic from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA, 1998. He joined the Computer Science Department at Boston University in October 2001, and is currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science. Dr. Xis research primarily focuses on applying advanced type theory to modern programming language design and implementation. He is the principal designer and implementor of the ATS programming language, which aims to facilitate the construction of safe and reliable software by advocating a programming paradigm that combines programming with theorem proving. Dr. Xi has done a large body of pioneering work on supporting dependent types and linear types for practical programming. He also served on the program committees of several prestigious ACM conferences on programming languages (e.g., POPL, PLDI and ICFP). Zhiqiang Ren and Hongwei Xi.
