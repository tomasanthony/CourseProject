From 1983 to 1990, he was employed as an electrical design engineer for the Defense Systems and Electronics Group of Texas Instruments (now Raytheon). While at TI, he designed wideband microwave receivers and components for electromagnetic sensing systems. From 1990 to 1996, Dr. Stiles was employed as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of Michigan, where he worked on research and experiments related to radar remote sensing. Since 1996, Dr. Stiles has been a faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kansas. His research activities at KU have focused entirely on electromagnetic sensing, with a primary interest in radar.
