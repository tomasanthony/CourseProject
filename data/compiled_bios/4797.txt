 Bharath Hariharan We are all trapped between the beautiful blueprints of the most perfect systems and the World that contradicts itself, the World that is "large and contains multitudes" - Stefan Themerson, The Mystery of the Sardine Note to prospective PhD students: Admissions at Cornell are done through a committee. If you are interested in working with me, please directly apply through the application website and mention my name My interests are broadly in recognition in computer vision. I want to build systems that understand the visual world as well as people do. Currently, I am working on building systems that can learn about tens of thousands of visual concepts with very little or no supervision, produce rich and detailed outputs such as precise 3D shape, and reason about the world and communicate this reasoning to humans. Before joining Cornell, I was a postdoc working with Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollr, Larry Zitnick, Laurens van der Maaten and other amazing people at Facebook AI Research. I did my PhD at beautiful Berkeley with Jitendra Malik. My CV is here .
