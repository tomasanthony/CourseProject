Using standardized protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project and sample contributions from over 10,000 citizen-scientists, together with an open research network, we compare human microbiome specimens primarily from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia to one another and to environmental samples. Our results show an unexpected range of beta-diversity in human stool microbiomes compared to environmental samples; demonstrate the utility of procedures for removing the effects of overgrowth during room-temperature shipping for revealing phenotype correlations; uncover new molecules and kinds of molecular communities in the human stool metabolome; and examine emergent associations among the microbiome, metabolome, and the diversity of plants that are consumed (rather than relying on reductive categorical variables such as veganism, which have little or no explanatory power). We also demonstrate the utility of the living data resource and cross-cohort comparison to confirm existing associations between the microbiome and psychiatric illness and to reveal the extent of microbiome change within one individual during surgery, providing a paradigm for open microbiome research and education. IMPORTANCE We show that a citizen science, self-selected cohort shipping samples through the mail at room temperature recaptures many known microbiome results from clinically collected cohorts and reveals new ones. Of particular interest is integrating n = 1 study data with the population data, showing that the extent of microbiome change after events such as surgery can exceed differences between distinct environmental biomes, and the effect of diverse plants in the diet, which we confirm with untargeted metabolomics on hundreds of samples. }, } ( tweet ) 2018 Journal Waldisphl, Zhang, Butyaev, Nazarova, Cyr (2018).

These interaction networks are essential to shape the 3D architecture of the molecule, and also to provide the key elements to carry molecular functions such as protein or ligand binding. They are made of organised sets of long-range tertiary interactions which connect distinct secondary structure elements in 3D structures. Here, we present a de novo data-driven approach to extract automatically from large data sets of full RNA 3D structures the recurrent interaction networks (RINs). Our methodology enables us for the first time to detect the interaction networks connecting distinct components of the RNA structure, highlighting their diversity and conservation through non-related functional RNAs. We use a graphical model to perform pairwise comparisons of all RNA structures available and to extract RINs and modules. Our analysis yields a complete catalog of RNA 3D structures available in the Protein Data Bank and reveals the intricate hierarchical organization of the RNA interaction networks and modules. We assembled our results in an online database (http://carnaval.lri.fr) which will be regularly updated. Within the site, a tool allows users with a novel RNA structure to detect automatically whether the novel structure contains previously observed RINs. }, } ( tweet ) 2018 Journal Baaden, Delalande, Ferey, Pasquali, Waldisphl, Taly (2018).

Given a secondary structure, these programs aim to predict sequences that fold into a target minimum free energy secondary structure, while considering various constraints. This procedure is called inverse RNA folding. Inverse RNA folding has been traditionally used to design optimized RNAs with favorable properties, an application that is expected to grow considerably in the future in light of advances in the expanding new fields of synthetic biology and RNA nanostructures. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that inverse RNA folding can successfully be used as a valuable preprocessing step in computational detection of novel noncoding RNAs. This review describes the most popular freeware programs that have been developed for such purposes, starting from RNAinverse that was devised when formulating the inverse RNA folding problem. The most recently published ones that consider RNA secondary structure as input are antaRNA, RNAiFold and incaRNAfbinv, each having different features that could be beneficial to specific biological problems in practice. The various programs also use distinct approaches, ranging from ant colony optimization to constraint programming, in addition to adaptive walk, simulated annealing and Boltzmann sampling. This review compares between the various programs and provides a simple description of the various possibilities that would benefit practitioners in selecting the most suitable program. It is geared for specific tasks requiring RNA design based on input secondary structure, with an outlook toward the future of RNA design programs. }, } ( tweet ) 2017 Journal Yao, Reinharz, Major, Waldisphl (2017).

Competing models for the misfolding and aggregation phenomena have suggested the role of the Htt-N-terminal region and the CAG trinucleotide repeats (polyQ domain) in affecting aggregation propensities and misfolding. In particular, one model suggests a correlation between structural stability and the emergence of toxic oligomers, whereas a second model proposes that molecular interactions with the extended polyQ domain increase aggregation propensity. In this paper, we computationally explore the potential to reduce Htt aggregation by addressing the aggregation causes outlined in both models. We investigate the mutation landscape of the Htt-N-terminal region and explore amino acid residue mutations that affect its structural stability and hydrophobic interactions with the polyQ domain. Out of the millions of 3-point mutation combinations that we explored, the (L4K E12K K15E) was the most promising mutation combination that addressed aggregation causes in both models. The mutant structure exhibited extreme alpha-helical stability, low amyloidogenicity potential, a hydrophobic residue replacement, and removal of a solvent-inaccessible intermolecular side chain that assists oligomerization. }, } ( tweet ) 2016 Journal Tremblay-Savard, Reinharz, Waldisphl (2016).

An accurate reconstruction of ancestral ncRNAs must use this structural signal. However, the inference of ancestors of a single ncRNA family with a single consensus structure may bias the results towards sequences with high affinity to this structure, which are far from the true ancestors. METHODS: In this paper, we introduce achARNement, a maximum parsimony approach that, given two alignments of homologous ncRNA families with consensus secondary structures and a phylogenetic tree, simultaneously calculates ancestral RNA sequences for these two families. RESULTS: We test our methodology on simulated data sets, and show that achARNement outperforms classical maximum parsimony approaches in terms of accuracy, but also reduces by several orders of magnitude the number of candidate sequences. To conclude this study, we apply our algorithms on the Glm clan and the FinP-traJ clan from the Rfam database. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that our methods reconstruct small sets of high-quality candidate ancestors with better agreement to the two target structures than with classical approaches.

Different methods have explored ways to impede and inhibit amyloid aggregation. Most attempts in the literature involve applying stress to the environment around amyloids. Varying pH levels, modifying temperature, applying pressure through protein crowding and ligand docking are classical examples of these methods. However, environmental stress usually affects molecular pathways and protein functions in the cell and is challenging to construct in vivo. In this paper, we explore destabilizing amyloid proteins through the manipulation of genetic code to create beneficial substitute molecules for patients with certain deficiencies. RESULTS: To unravel sequence mutations that destabilize amyloid fibrils yet simultaneously conserve native fold, we analyze the structural landscape of amyloid proteins and search for potential areas that could be exploited to weaken aggregation. Our tool, FibrilMutant, analyzes these regions and studies the effect of amino acid point mutations on nucleation and aggregation. This multiple objective approach impedes aggregation without stressing the cellular environment. We identified six main regions in amyloid proteins that contribute to structural stability and generated amino acid mutations to destabilize those regions. Full length fibrils were built from the mutated amyloid monomers and a dipolar-solvent model capturing the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability was used to generate energy plots. CONCLUSION: Our results are in agreement with experimental studies and suggest novel targeted single point mutations in the Amylin protein, potentially creating a better therapeutic agent than the currently administered Pramlintide drug for diabetes patients. }, } ( tweet ) 2015 Journal Smaoui, Waldisphl (2015).

Amylin, the regulatory hormone that is co-secreted with insulin, has been observed to misfold into toxic structures. Pramlintide, an FDA approved injectable amylin analog mutated at positions 25, 28, and 29 was therefore developed to create a more stable, soluble, less-aggregating, and equipotent peptide that is used as an adjunctive therapy for diabetes. However, because Pramlintide is not ideal, researchers have been exploring other amylin analogs as therapeutic replacements. In this work, we assist the finding of optimal analogs by computationally revealing the mutational landscape of amylin. We computed the structure energies of all possible single-point mutations and studied the effect they have on amylin stability and amyloidogenicity. Each of the 37 amylin residues was mutated in silico into the 19 canonical amino acids and an energy function computing the Lennard-Jones, Coulomb and solvation energy was used to analyze changes in stability. The mutation landscape identified amylin's conserved stable regions, residues that can be tweaked to further stabilize structure, regions that are susceptible to mutations, and mutations that are amyloidogenic. We used the single-point mutational landscape data to generate estimations for higher-order multiple-point mutational landscapes and discovered millions of three-point mutations that are more stable and less amyloidogenic than Pramlintide. The landscapes provided an explanation for the effect of the S20G and Q10R mutations on the onset of diabetes of the Chinese and Maori populations, respectively. }, } ( tweet ) 2015 Journal Smaoui, Orland, Waldisphl (2015).

In particular, short amyloid oligomers inject themselves into the membranes of these cells and create pores that disrupt the strictly controlled flow of ions through the membranes. This leads to cell death. Getting rid of the short oligomers either by a deconstruction process or by elongating them into longer fibrils will reduce this toxicity and allow the -cells to live longer. RESULTS: We develop a computational method to probe the binding affinity of amyloid structures and produce an amylin analog that binds to oligomers and extends their length. The binding and extension lower toxicity and -cell death. The amylin analog is designed through a parsimonious selection of mutations and is to be administered with the pramlintide drug, but not to interact with it. The mutations (T9K L12K S28H T30K) produce a stable native structure, strong binding affinity to oligomers, and long fibrils. We present an extended mathematical model for the insulin-glucose relationship and demonstrate how affecting the concentration of oligomers with such analog is strictly coupled with insulin release and -cell fitness.

We present partiFold-Align, the first algorithm for simultaneous alignment and consensus folding of unaligned protein sequences; the algorithm's complexity is polynomial in time and space. Algorithmically, partiFold-Align exploits sparsity in the set of super-secondary structure pairings and alignment candidates to achieve an effectively cubic running time for simultaneous pairwise alignment and folding. We demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques on transmembrane -barrel proteins, an important yet difficult class of proteins with few known three-dimensional structures. Testing against structurally derived sequence alignments, partiFold-Align significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise and multiple sequence alignment tools in the most difficult low-sequence homology case. It also improves secondary structure prediction where current approaches fail. Importantly, partiFold-Align requires no prior training.

Interactions within protein complexes are modulated through regulatory inputs that alter interactions and introduce new components and deplete existing components through exchange. While it is clear that the structure and function of any given protein complex is coupled to its dynamical properties, it remains a challenge to predict the possible conformations that complexes can adopt. Protein-fragment Complementation Assays detect physical interactions between protein pairs constrained to 8 nm from each other in living cells. This method has been used to build networks composed of 1000s of pair-wise interactions. Significantly, these networks contain a wealth of dynamic information, as the assay is fully reversible and the proteins are expressed in their natural context. In this study, we describe a method that extracts this valuable information in the form of predicted conformations, allowing the user to explore the conformational landscape, to search for structures that correlate with an activity state, and estimate the abundance of conformations in the living cell. The generator is based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation that uses the interaction dataset as input and is constrained by the physical resolution of the assay. We applied this method to an 18-member protein complex composed of the seven core proteins of the budding yeast Arp2/3 complex and 11 associated regulators and effector proteins. We generated 20,480 output structures and identified conformational states using principle component analysis. We interrogated the conformation landscape and found evidence of symmetry breaking, a mixture of likely active and inactive conformational states and dynamic exchange of the core protein Arc15 between core and regulatory components. Our method provides a novel tool for prediction and visualization of the hidden dynamics within protein interaction networks. }, } ( tweet ) 2014 Misc Smaoui, Waldisphl (2014).

Experimental and computational studies have examined the structural basis and the nucleation of short fibrils, but the ability to predict and precisely quantify the stability of larger aggregates has remained elusive. We established a complete classification of fibril shapes and developed a tool called CreateFibril to build such complex, polymorphic, modular structures automatically. We applied stability landscapes, a technique we developed to reveal reliable fibril structural parameters, to assess fibril stability. CreateFibril constructed HET-s, A, and amylin fibrils up to 17 nm in length, and utilized a novel dipolar solvent model that captured the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability. Our results validate experimental data for HET-s and A, and suggest novel (to our knowledge) findings for amylin. In particular, we predicted the correct structural parameters (rotation angles, packing distances, hydrogen bond lengths, and helical pitches) for the one and three predominant HET-s protofilaments. We reveal and structurally characterize all known A polymorphic fibrils, including structures recently classified as wrapped fibrils. Finally, we elucidate the predominant amylin fibrils and assert that native amylin is more stable than its amyloid form.

Most of the current software uses similar local search strategies (i.e. a random seed is progressively adapted to acquire the desired folding properties) and more importantly do not allow the user to control explicitly the nucleotide distribution such as the GC-content in their sequences. However, the latter is an important criterion for large-scale applications as it could presumably be used to design sequences with better transcription rates and/or structural plasticity. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce IncaRNAtion, a novel algorithm to design RNA sequences folding into target secondary structures with a predefined nucleotide distribution. IncaRNAtion uses a global sampling approach and weighted sampling techniques. We show that our approach is fast (i.e. running time comparable or better than local search methods), seedless (we remove the bias of the seed in local search heuristics) and successfully generates high-quality sequences (i.e. thermodynamically stable) for any GC-content. To complete this study, we develop a hybrid method combining our global sampling approach with local search strategies. Remarkably, our glocal methodology overcomes both local and global approaches for sampling sequences with a specific GC-content and target structure.

To date, this problem remains computationally difficult, and current strategies to address it resort to heuristics and stochastic search techniques. The most popular methods consist of two steps: First a random seed sequence is generated; next, this seed is progressively modified (i.e. mutated) to adopt the desired folding properties. Although computationally inexpensive, this approach raises several questions such as (i) the influence of the seed; and (ii) the efficiency of single-path directed searches that may be affected by energy barriers in the mutational landscape. In this article, we present RNA-ensign, a novel paradigm for RNA design. Instead of taking a progressive adaptive walk driven by local search criteria, we use an efficient global sampling algorithm to examine large regions of the mutational landscape under structural and thermodynamical constraints until a solution is found. When considering the influence of the seeds and the target secondary structures, our results show that, compared to single-path directed searches, our approach is more robust, succeeds more often and generates more thermodynamically stable sequences. An ensemble approach to RNA design is thus well worth pursuing as a complement to existing approaches.

In recent years, many methods addressed this challenge, ranging from cycle decomposition and fragment assembly to molecular dynamics simulations. However, their predictions remain fragile and limited to small RNAs. To expand the range and accuracy of these techniques, we need to develop algorithms that will enable to use all the structural information available. In particular, the energetic contribution of secondary structure interactions is now well documented, but the quantification of non-canonical interactions-those shaping the tertiary structure-is poorly understood. Nonetheless, even if a complete RNA tertiary structure energy model is currently unavailable, we now have catalogues of local 3D structural motifs including non-canonical base pairings. A practical objective is thus to develop techniques enabling us to use this knowledge for robust RNA tertiary structure predictors. RESULTS: In this work, we introduce RNA-MoIP, a program that benefits from the progresses made over the last 30 years in the field of RNA secondary structure prediction and expands these methods to incorporate the novel local motif information available in databases. Using an integer programming framework, our method refines predicted secondary structures (i.e. removes incorrect canonical base pairs) to accommodate the insertion of RNA 3D motifs (i.e. hairpins, internal loops and k-way junctions). Then, we use predictions as templates to generate complete 3D structures with the MC-Sym program. We benchmarked RNA-MoIP on a set of 9 RNAs with sizes varying from 53 to 128 nucleotides. We show that our approach (i) improves the accuracy of canonical base pair predictions; (ii) identifies the best secondary structures in a pool of suboptimal structures; and (iii) predicts accurate 3D structures of large RNA molecules.

However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying "crowd sourcing" techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70% of the alignment blocks considered. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of "human-brain peta-flops" of computation that are spent every day playing games.

However, the specific molecular structure of a fibril can vary dramatically depending on sequence and environmental conditions, and mutations can drastically alter amyloid function and pathogenicity. Experimental structure determination has proven extremely difficult with only a handful of NMR-based models proposed, suggesting a need for computational methods. RESULTS: We present AmyloidMutants, a statistical mechanics approach for de novo prediction and analysis of wild-type and mutant amyloid structures. Based on the premise of protein mutational landscapes, AmyloidMutants energetically quantifies the effects of sequence mutation on fibril conformation and stability. Tested on non-mutant, full-length amyloid structures with known chemical shift data, AmyloidMutants offers roughly 2-fold improvement in prediction accuracy over existing tools. Moreover, AmyloidMutants is the only method to predict complete super-secondary structures, enabling accurate discrimination of topologically dissimilar amyloid conformations that correspond to the same sequence locations. Applied to mutant prediction, AmyloidMutants identifies a global conformational switch between A and its highly-toxic 'Iowa' mutant in agreement with a recent experimental model based on partial chemical shift data. Predictions on mutant, yeast-toxic strains of HET-s suggest similar alternate folds. When applied to HET-s and a HET-s mutant with core asparagines replaced by glutamines (both highly amyloidogenic chemically similar residues abundant in many amyloids), AmyloidMutants surprisingly predicts a greatly reduced capacity of the glutamine mutant to form amyloid. We confirm this finding by conducting mutagenesis experiments.

Because their structures can be predicted from the sequence data only, RNA molecules provide a good framework to study this sequence-structure relationship. We recently introduced a suite of algorithms called RNAmutants which allows a complete exploration of RNA sequence-structure maps in polynomial time and space. Formally, RNAmutants takes an input sequence (or seed) to compute the Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of mutants with exactly k mutations, and sample mutations from these ensembles. However, this approach suffers from major limitations. Indeed, since the Boltzmann probabilities of the mutations depend of the free energy of the structures, RNAmutants has difficulties to sample mutant sequences with low G+C-contents. In this article, we introduce an unbiased adaptive sampling algorithm that enables RNAmutants to sample regions of the mutational landscape poorly covered by classical algorithms. We applied these methods to sample mutations with low G+C-contents. These adaptive sampling techniques can be easily adapted to explore other regions of the sequence and structural landscapes which are difficult to sample. Importantly, these algorithms come at a minimal computational cost. We demonstrate the insights offered by these techniques on studies of complete RNA sequence structures maps of sizes up to 40 nucleotides. Our results indicate that the G+C-content has a strong influence on the size and shape of the evolutionary accessible sequence and structural spaces. In particular, we show that low G+C-contents favor the apparition of internal loops and thus possibly the synthesis of tertiary structure motifs. On the other hand, high G+C-contents significantly reduce the size of the evolutionary accessible mutational landscapes. }, } ( tweet ) 2011 Journal Shenker, O'Donnell, Devadas, Berger, Waldisphl (2011).

Larger and slower-folding proteins, such as many with extended -sheet structure, would require orders of magnitude more time and computing resources. Furthermore, when the objective is to determine only which folding events are necessary and limiting, atomistic detail MD simulations can prove unnecessary. Here, we introduce the program tFolder as an efficient method for modelling the folding process of large -sheet proteins using sequence data alone. To do so, we extend existing ensemble -sheet prediction techniques, which permitted only a fixed anti-parallel -barrel shape, with a method that predicts arbitrary -strand/-strand orientations and strand-order permutations. By accounting for all partial and final structural states, we can then model the transition from random coil to native state as a Markov process, using a master equation to simulate population dynamics of folding over time. Thus, all putative folding pathways can be energetically scored, including which transitions present the greatest barriers. Since correct folding pathway prediction is likely determined by the accuracy of contact prediction, we demonstrate the accuracy of tFolder to be comparable with state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for the contact prediction problem alone. We validate our method for dynamics prediction by applying it to the folding pathway of the well-studied Protein G. With relatively very little computation time, tFolder is able to reveal critical features of the folding pathways which were only previously observed through time-consuming MD simulations and experimental studies. Such a result greatly expands the number of proteins whose folding pathways can be studied, while the algorithmic integration of ensemble prediction with Markovian dynamics can be applied to many other problems. }, } ( tweet ) 2011 Journal Lam, Kam, Waldisphl (2011). corRna: a web server for predicting multiple-point deleterious mutations in structural RNAs.

In contrast to DNA, the function of most noncoding RNA depends on tertiary structure, experimentally known to be largely determined by secondary structure, for which dynamic programming can efficiently compute the minimum free energy secondary structure. For this reason, understanding the effect of pointwise mutations in RNA secondary structure could reveal fundamental properties of structural RNA molecules and improve our understanding of molecular evolution of RNA.

This broad range of functions is achieved through specific structures that have been (presumably) optimized through evolution. State-of-the-art methods, such as McCaskill's algorithm, use a statistical mechanics framework based on the computation of the partition function over the canonical ensemble of all possible secondary structures on a given sequence. Although secondary structure predictions from thermodynamics-based algorithms are not as accurate as methods employing comparative genomics, the former methods are the only available tools to investigate novel RNAs, such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium. In this paper, we generalize the McCaskill partition function algorithm to sum over the grand canonical ensemble of all secondary structures of all mutants of the given sequence. Specifically, our new program, RNAmutants, simultaneously computes for each integer k the minimum free energy structure MFE(k) and the partition function Z(k) over all secondary structures of all k-point mutants, even allowing the user to specify certain positions required not to mutate and certain positions required to base-pair or remain unpaired. This technically important extension allows us to study the resilience of an RNA molecule to pointwise mutations. By computing the mutation profile of a sequence, a novel graphical representation of the mutational tendency of nucleotide positions, we analyze the deleterious nature of mutating specific nucleotide positions or groups of positions. We have successfully applied RNAmutants to investigate deleterious mutations (mutations that radically modify the secondary structure) in the Hepatitis C virus cis-acting replication element and to evaluate the evolutionary pressure applied on different regions of the HIV trans-activation response element. In particular, we show qualitative agreement between published Hepatitis C and HIV experimental mutagenesis studies and our analysis of deleterious mutations using RNAmutants. Our work also predicts other deleterious mutations, which could be verified experimentally. Finally, we provide evidence that the 3' UTR of the GB RNA virus C has been optimized to preserve evolutionarily conserved stem regions from a deleterious effect of pointwise mutations. We hope that there will be long-term potential applications of RNAmutants in de novo RNA design and drug design against RNA viruses.

By computing the Boltzmann partition function, partiFold estimates inter-beta-strand residue interaction probabilities, predicts contacts and per-residue X-ray crystal structure B-values, and samples conformations from the Boltzmann low energy ensemble. This broad range of predictive capabilities is achieved using a single, parameterizable grammatical model to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures, combined with a novel energy function of stacked amino acid pair statistical potentials. PartiFold outperforms existing programs for inter-beta-strand residue contact prediction on TMB proteins, offering both higher average predictive accuracy as well as more consistent results. Moreover, the integration of these contact probabilities inside a stochastic contact map can be used to infer a more meaningful picture of the TMB folding landscape, which cannot be achieved with other methods. Partifold's predictions of B-values are competitive with recent methods specifically designed for this problem.

A novel method using pairwise interstrand residue statistical potentials derived from globular (nonouter membrane) proteins is introduced to predict the supersecondary structure of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure. Hence, the approach can be viewed as a "wrapping" component that may capture folding processes with an initiation stage followed by progressive interaction of the sequence with the already-formed motifs. This approach differs significantly from others, which use traditional machine learning to solve this problem, because it does not require a training phase on known TMB structures and is the first to explicitly capture and predict long-range interactions. TransFold outperforms previous programs for predicting TMBs on smaller (<=200 residues) proteins and matches their performance for straightforward recognition of longer proteins. An exception is for multimeric porins where the algorithm does perform well when an important functional motif in loops is initially identified.

Efficient algorithms have been developed to solve problems expressed with these tools, which generally compute the optimal attribute of the sequence w.r.t. the grammar. However, it is often more meaningful and/or interesting from the biological point of view to consider almost optimal attributes as well as approximate sequences; we thus need more flexible and powerful algorithms able to perform these generalized analyses. RESULTS: In this paper we present a basic algorithm which, given a grammar G and a sequence omega, computes the optimal attribute for all (approximate) strings omega(') in L(G) such that d(omega, omega(')) < or = M, and whose complexity is O(n(r + 1)) in time and O(n(2)) in space (r is the maximal length of the right-hand side of any production of G). We will also give some extensions and possible improvements of this algorithm. }, } ( tweet ) Showing 1 to 57 of 57 entries TEACHINGS COMP 564: Advanced Computation Biology Methods & Research Winter 2019 COMP 401: Project in Biology and Computer Science Winter 2019 COMP 251: Algorithms and Data Structures Fall 2018 COMP 250: Introduction to Computer Science Winter 2018 COMP 401: Project in Biology and Computer Science Winter 2018 COMP 598: Advanced Computation Biology Methods & Research Fall 2017 COMP 401: Project in Biology and Computer Science Fall 2017 COMP 251: Algorithms and Data Structures Winter 2017 COMP 766: An Introduction to Crowdsourcing and Human-Computation Techniques Fall 2016 COMP 598: Advanced Computation Biology Methods & Research Fall 2016 COMP 250: Introduction to Computer Science Fall 2015 COMP 251: Algorithms and Data Structures Winter 2015 COMP 250: Introduction to Computer Science Fall 2014 COMP 598: Advanced Computation Biology Methods & Research Winter 2014 COMP 462/561: Computation Biology Methods & Research Fall 2013 COMP 766: An Introduction to Crowdsourcing and Human-Computation Techniques Winter 2013 COMP 364: Computer Tools for Life Science Winter 2013 COMP 761: Foundation of Computational Structural Biology Winter 2012 COMP 462/561: Computation Biology Methods & Research Fall 2012 COMP 761: Foundation of Computational Structural Biology Winter 2011 COMP 462/561: Computation Biology Methods & Research Fall 2011 COMP 252: Honours Algorithms and Data Structures Winter 2010 CONTACT My lab is located at the third floor of the Trottier Building .
