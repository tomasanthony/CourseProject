Aero. and Astro., China, 1995 MS in Systems Engineering, Univ. of Maryland, College Park, 1997 PhD in Electrical Engineering, Univ. of Maryland, College Park, 2000 I came to Ann Arbor, Michigan in August 2000, and have been with this department ever since. Prior to that I was a graduate student in the ECE Department and the Institute for Systems Research (ISR) at the University of Maryland, College Park. Myresearch interests are in optimal resource allocation, sequential decision theory, incentive design, and performance modeling and analysis, all within the context of communication networks. My most recent research activities involve online learning, modeling and mining of large scale Internet measurement data and the design of incentive mechanisms for cyber security. I was a recipient of the 2002 NSF CAREER Award, the University of Michigan Elizabeth C. Crosby Research Award in 2003 and 2014, the 2010 EECS Department Outstanding Achievement Award, the 2015 College of Engineering Excellence in Education Award, and the 2017 College of Engineering Excellence in Service Award. I received a number of Best Paper Awards, including one at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) in 2012 and one at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA) in 2014. I served on the editorial boards of IEEE/ACM Trans. Networking, IEEE Trans. Mobile Computing, and ACM Trans. Sensor Networks. I am a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the ACM.
