I am an assistant professor of Information Systems (IS) at College of Computing and Digital Media (CDM) at DePaul University. My research is at the intersection of social and technological systems and particularly addresses the behavioral and managerial implications of information systems, including the positive and negative impacts of using information systems and consumer-generated contents. My research outputs have appeared in various journals and conferences in Information Systems, such as Journal of Management Information Systems, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, Information & Management, New Media & Society, Computers & Education, Expert Systems with Applications, Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce, and European Financial Review. I have also held several editorial positions in journals and conferences in Information Systems. I have served in different capacities as an editor, a reviewer, a mini-track chair, and a session chair for various IS journals and conferences. For more details, please visit my personal homepage.
