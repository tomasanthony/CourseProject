Manos Athanassoulis will be starting as an Assistant Professor January 2019. He conducts research in the area of data systems, with particular emphasis on studying the interplay between new storage and computing hardware, modern complex workloads, and data systems architecture. He has a PhD from cole polytechnique fdrale de Lausanne (2014). He holds a MSc on Computer Systems Technology (2008) and a BSc on Informatics and Telecommunications (2005), both from the University of Athens, Greece. He currently serves as a SNSF Postdoctoral Fellow and a Research Associate at Harvard University. Manos has won an IBM PhD Fellowship and a SNSF Postdoc Mobility award. For his research on data systems architecture, Manos won three top picks in ACM SIGMOD and VLDB, a Most Reproducible Paper award in ACM SIGMOD, and has delivered a tutorial on Access Method Design in the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Data Management.
