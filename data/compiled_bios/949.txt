Before that he was a post-doctoral researcher at Columbia University working with Prof. Eitan Grinspun. He received a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Olga Sorkine-Hornung, and an MA and BA in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. His PhD thesis on real-time deformation techniques for 2D and 3D shapes was awarded the ETH Medal and the Eurographics Best PhD award. Leveraging ideas from differential geometry and finite-element analysis, his work in geometry processing improves exposure of geometric quantities, while his novel user interfaces reduce human effort and increase exploration. He has published several papers in the proceedings of SIGGRAPH. He leads development of the widely used geometry processing library, libigl, winner of the 2015 SGP software award. In 2017, he received the Eurographics Young Researcher Award. Frequently Asked Questions These are some questions that I receive fairly regularly in cold-call emails. Will you hire me as a PhD Student? Maybe! The first step is to apply directly to the graduate program of the Department of Computer Science or Department of Mathematics . Our regular deadline is in December for students applying to start in the following Fall. Our program is very competitive. Most students put months of effort into their application package. Your research interests should match or harmonize with mine (see publications above for an idea). You should not only mention this in your application (and mention me by name), but also write about how and why were a great match. If youd like to chat about research or life at dgp as a graduate student, feel free to contact me. Will you hire me as a postdoc? Maybe! Postdoc positions are very limited. If Im not already aware of your research then chances are much smaller. In any case, contact me to begin the conversation. Have a one-to-two year research agenda prepared. In nearly all circumstances, I will ask you to apply for a postdoc fellowship (and I will help you apply). Please review relevant fellowships, including those specifically for Canadian permanent residences (if applicable) or mobility fellowships from your home country/country of PhD. Im an undergrad from University of Toronto, could I work as your research assistant? Maybe! Undergraduate research assistantships are limited and competitive. You should be a proficient programmer and feel confident in Calculus and Linear Algebra . If you havent already, sign up for the undergraduate Computer Graphics course and my graduate-level Geometry Processing course (and probably also David Levins Computational Fabrication and Kyros Kutulakuss Foundations of Computational Vision courses). Good performance in these courses will put you at a great advantage. Also, start attending the dgp graphics reading group and the dgp graphics seminar talks. If youre hoping to work with me over the summer, reach out to me around January/February. Give an indication of what research of mine most interests you and what sort of way you could imagine yourself contributing (in practice, we will try to find a current project to match you with, but this information will help). Im an undergrad from X Unversity of Toronto , could I work as a your research assistant? Maybe! External undergraduate research assistantships are even more limited than internal ones . If you can secure or apply for funding from your home institution or country then you will be at a great advantage. If you do not already have a funding source, then before contacting me investigate whether fellowships for exchange programs etc. exist in your institution/country. If there are none, then consider applying to one of the summer undergraduate research fellowship programs at University of Toronto (e.g., at the Fields Institute). Finally, if you still cannot find funding, contact me with an application including a statement of purpose, faculty references, (unofficial) transcripts, and resume.
