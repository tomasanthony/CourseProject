He was interviewed by Healthcare Analytics News on How Edge Computing Can Advance Healthcare in January 2018. Dr. Shi is a recipient of the National Outstanding Ph.D. dissertation award of China (2002), the NSF CAREER award (2007), Wayne State University Career Development Chair award (2009), Charles H. Gershenson Distinguished Faculty Fellow (2015), College of Engineering Faculty Research Excellence Award (2016), the Best Paper award of ICWE'04, IEEE IPDPS'05, HPCChina'12, IEEE IISWC'12, the Best Paper Nominee award of ACM UbiComp'14, the Best Student Paper Award of IEEE HealthCom'15, IEEE eHealth Best Paper Award 2017. He is an IEEE Fellow and a Distinguished Scientist of ACM. According to Google Scholar, his H-index is 39 and has a total of 6000+ citations. Dr. Shi's research group is actively collaborating with industry partners, such as Alibaba, Baidu, DENSO, Facebook, IBM, Intel, InterDigital, to name a few. Dr. Shi was on leave with the National Science Foundation as a program director in the Division of Computer and Network Systems, Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering during 2013-2015. During his tenure at NSF, Dr. Shi mainly responsible for the Computer Systems Research (CSR) core program and two crosscutting programs, including Cyber-Innovation for Sustainability Science and Engineering (CyberSEES), Smart and Connected Health (SCH). Dr. Shi has been actively involved in the activities of IEEE Computer Society. He had served as the Chair of the Technical Committee on the Internet (TCI) during 2012-2016. He is currently serving on the Research Advisory Board (RAB) of IEEE Computer Society.
