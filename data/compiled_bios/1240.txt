 Heiner Litz Assistant Professor Contact Information Engineering 2 University of California, Santa Cruz ude.cscu@ztilh Welcome to my webpage! I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) Department of the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz. My main research interests are in Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Storage with a focus on data centers. My work addresses the unique challenges of data center systems, such as extreme scale, the insatiable need for higher performance at lower cost and the performance predictability of multi-tenancy systems. I am also interested in machine learning and its application to processor microarchitecture and systems. Before joining UCSC I was a Postdoc at Stanford University where I worked with Christos Kozyrakis and David Cheriton . I received my PhD from Mannheim University. I am looking for great PhD and MS students to join my lab. If you are interested, please get in contact with me. I have two open Postdoc positions. If you are interested in data center storage systems or machine learning techniques to improve micro architecture and Operating Systems please get in contact with me.
