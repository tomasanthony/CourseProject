 About Education Business Teaching Research Projects Socrates Dimitriadis still resisting social media, you won't find me anyweb else I was born and raised in Kilkis a small town of Central Macedonia, Greece but have lived in several other places such as Ioannina, Athens, Xanthi, Heraklion, Providence, Zrich, Seattle, Boston and Washington DC. I'm a computing professional working on and for the Internet, and I have a keen interest in sports, especially road running. I love traveling (who doesn't?) and I try to combine it with outdoor activities such as hiking, snowboarding, snorkeling and boating. My other half, Foteini, is a cryptographer at George Mason University, and Danae is my sunshine! Education As a kid, I spent many years learning foreign languages (French, German, Italian) that I can hardly speak any more. Later, I studied computer science at the Universities of Ioannina and Crete, and then I kind of switched to cognitive science at Brown University. A few yeas ago I completed a flight school for single engine land & sea airplanes, and nowadays I'm trying to study a bit of business administration. I've always been intrigued by the process of learning, both academically and personally, and I'm a strong supporter of lifelong education. Brown University Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences [ PhD thesis ] Visual Recognition with a Large Scale Network of Dynamical Systems [ MSc thesis ] A Network of Networks Approach to Computational Modeling of Pop-out Phenomena in Visual Attention 2003 - 2010 University of Crete Department of Computer Science [ MSc thesis ] An Image Retrieval Platform Based on a Biologically Inspired Architecture 2000 - 2002 University of Ioannina Department of Computer Science [ BSc thesis ] Human-Computer Interaction with Gesture Recognition 1995 - 1999 Business Founder & Full-Stack Developer 2006-2018 It started as a hobby while in grad school and ended up becoming a full fledged business. A combination of right timing and risk seeking made Greek-Movies the first search engine of - exclusively Greek - video streaming, and a site that was serving one million visitors per month. As a full stack developer I was taking care of everything, from system administration and back-end development to front-end responsive design and adertising. It may not be the trend any more but it gave me the privilege of experiencing software development to its fullest extent and I loved it. Working on every aspect of a website, from the engineering all the way to the marketing and the regulatory compliance, offers a unique perspective on the Internet.

High performance computing with MPI and C++ on an IBM 166-node linux cluster. Watch a few visualizations of a system that models several features of the human visual recognition process. Each of these simulations models about 1 billion neural synapses and requires about 100 CPU cores for several minutes. 2005-2010 Visual detection of urban and landscape changes Brown University, School of Engineering Laboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems Computer Vision Use of satellite imagery for the detection and evaluation of landscape and urban changes 2008-2009 Computational modeling of human visual depth perception Brown University, Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences 3D Shape Perception Lab Bayesian modeling of visual depth perception for inference under limited cognitive resources 2005-2007 Computational modeling of human visual attention Brown University, Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences Ersatz Brain Group Modeling of popout phenomena in visual attention with a network of dynamical neural networks.
