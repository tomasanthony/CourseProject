Jonathan Buss	Jonathan Buss	Good morning! from the	Cheriton School of	Computer Science in the	Faculty of Mathematics of the	University of Waterloo.	I work in the	Algorithms and Complexity	Group.	Phone: 1-519-888-4567 x34428	Office: DC 3353	email: jfbuss  cs.uwaterloo.ca	Lecturing	In Fall 2018, I will teach CS245,	Logic and Computation.	I have taught the following courses at various times.	CS240: Data Structures and Data Management	CS245: Logic and Computation	CS251: Computer Organization and Design (formerly Digital Design and Architecture)	CS341: Algorithms	CS360: Introduction to Theory of Computation	CS	365: Models of Computation	CS462/662:	Formal Languages and Parsing	CS464/664: Computational Complexity Theory (no longer offered; see CS764)	CS466/666:	Algorithm Design and Analysis	CS764: Computational Complexity	CS860: Advanced Topics in Algorithms and Complexity	Research	My research work concerns computational complexity and	models of feasible computation. In particular, I study subsets of	polynomial-time problems, which better capture the feasibility of	computations. Lately I have extended the scope to include the	W-hierarchy of (possibly) fixed-parameter intractable problems.	Some selected papers	J.F. Buss, T.M.
