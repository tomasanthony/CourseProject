 Aurojit Panda 405, 60 Fifth Ave. apanda@cs.nyu.edu Mail Trackers Verboten @apanda apanda I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at NYU . Previously, I received my PhD from UC Berkeley where I was advised by Scott Shenker and worked in the NetSys Lab . Even earlier, I received a Sc.B. with honors in Math-CS from Brown . My research interests lie in finding lightweight mechanisms for achieving correctness in systems (broadly defined). My dissertation looked at how to implement and execute network functions; and how to verify correctness for NFV (network function virtualization) deployments. A selection of past projects and publications can be found on this site. Before starting at NYU, I spent a year as a software developer at Nefeli Networks , a startup focused on solutions for Network Function orchestration. Between Brown and Berkeley I spent a few years working on the Midori kernel at Microsoft.
