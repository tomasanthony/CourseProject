 Tao Yang Professor of Computer Science Harold Frank Hall, Room 5113 Department of Computer Science University of California Santa Barbara, CA 93106 Phone: (805) 893-4321 (Dept) Fax: (805) 893-8553 (Dept) tyang at cs dot ucsb Tao Yang received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University, China, in 1984, the M.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Zhejiang University in 1987. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Rutgers University in 1990 and 1993. He joined the Department of Computer Science at UCSB in 1993. His research has been in the areas of parallel and distributed systems, information retrieval, and high performance computing. He served for the organization and program committees of various web and high performance computing conferences including WWW, KDD, WSDM, ECIR, EMNLP, SC, IPDPS, PPoPP, SPAA, and INFOCOM, and was on the editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. He received the Research Initiation Award from NSF in 1994, UC Regents' Junior Faculty Award in 1994, the Computer Science Faculty Teacher Award in 1995 from the UCSB College of Engineering, and the CAREER Award from NSF in 1997, and Noble Jeeviant Award from AskJeeves, 2002. He served as Chief Scientist for Ask.com (formally Ask Jeeves) from 2001 to earlier 2010, and also VP/SVP of ASK as the head of its search engineering division in various periods. He was the founding Chief Scientist and Vice President of Research and Development from 2000 to 2001 for Teoma , an Internet search startup company acquired by Ask Jeeves in 2001. At Ask.com/Teoma, he has led teams of scientists and engineers for the design and implementation of a top-rated search engine and vertical products that power Ask.com , Ask Kids , Teoma , and other Ask network sites with over 100 million users. He has co-developed scalable search algorithms and systems for page indexing, retrieval, ranking, classification, and anti-spamming. He has been directly responsible for scaling search architectures for handling billions of documents in terms of relevancy, performance, and freshness. He has visited Microsoft Bing for search technology R&D in 2010 and 2011, and advised Panguso on search technology in 2012-2013. Publications UCSB undergraduates interested in research?
