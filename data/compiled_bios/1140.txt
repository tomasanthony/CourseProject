Gene Fisher Home Teaching Research Publications Personal I am currently an emeritus professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. I joined the department in 1990 and was a member of the full-time teaching faculty until January 2016. Since retirement from teaching, I've continued my research, focusing on the use of formal methods in software engineering. There are details of my current work under the research tab. Prior to joining the faculty at Poly, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of California Davis from 1983 to 1989. Before UC Davis, I worked in industry for several years following the completion of my BS degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Irvine. My most interesting and significant industrial position was at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I was a software analyst and technical writer from 1975 through 1979.
