Scottish Combinatorics Meeting We will be hosting the 5th Scottish Combinatorics Meeting in Edinburgh on the 25th and 26th April of 2019. Research Interests Algorithms, especially Algorithms for counting and sampling; Random Structures; Learning theory; Pseudorandom generators. Research papers here . Teaching I am (co)lecturing "Informatics 2A - Formal and Natural Languages" this semester (Autumn 2018). I wll be teaching "Randomness and Computation" next semester (Spring 2019). Admin For academic year 2018/19 I am overall Course Organiser for the 4th year Honours programmes within Informatics. I am also Deputy Director and PhD Selector for the Lab for the Foundations of Computer Science . I will be the Informatics "academic lead" for the Data Science apprenticeships and new degree programmes in 2018/19. PhD students Veselin Blagoev (autumn 2015 -> ) Pid Creed, Counting and Sampling problems on Eulerian graphs (2010). Now working on "Deep Learning" as an Industry Scientist in London. James Matthews (co-supervisor), Markov chains for sampling matchings (2008). Now working in Industry in Edinburgh. Biography I am originally from Dublin, and I did my undergraduate degree at University College Dublin , graduating with a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics in 1993. I returned to UCD for the 1994-1995 academic year to do an MSc by research in Computer Science, supervised by Allan Ramsay . After that I spent four years at the University of Warwick doing research for my PhD. At Warwick I was a member of the Algorithms and Computational Complexity Group , working with Leslie Ann Goldberg . Between September 1999 and August 2001 I was a postdoc at the Center for Basic Research in Computer Science (BRICS) at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Between September 2001 and May 2003 I was a postdoc with the Algorithms and Complexity Group of the University of Leeds, working on randomized algorithms with Martin Dyer . Since July 2003 I have been a lecturer in Informatics at Edinburgh. email: mcryan AT inf DOT ed DOT ac DOT uk
