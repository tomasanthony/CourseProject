I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I am also a core member of the DUB Group, our cross-campus initiative advancing Human-Computer Interaction and Design research and education. My broad research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, User Interface Software and Technology, and Ubiquitous Computing. My focus is on developing, deploying, and evaluating new approaches to the human obstacles surrounding widespread everyday adoption of ubiquitous sensing and intelligent computing technologies. I pursue this work together with an outstanding group of collaborators and amazing advisees: Daniel Epstein Ravi Karkar Katerena Kuksenok Greg Nelson Laura Pina Anne Ross Jessie Schroeder Amanda Swearngin Xiaoyi Zhang My research has been directly supported by the National Science Foundation and by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
