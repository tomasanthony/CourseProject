Yuan Tian Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio PhD, Carnegie Mellon University My research interests involve security and privacy and its interactions with system, networking, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. My current research focuses on developing new technologies for protecting user privacy, particularly in the areas of mobile systems and Internet of Things. My previous work about mobile and web security and privacy have been adopted by Google (Chrome HTML5 privacy), Facebook (flaw analysis for web services, authentication protection), Microsoft (login protection), Samsung (mobile app security), Evernote (OAuth security), Dropbox (OAuth security), and others.
