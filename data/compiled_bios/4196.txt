Oleg focuses his research interests on the application of formal methods to design and verify distributed real-time systems. He works on modeling and analysis of computer-based systems, particularly medical devices, which require high levels of confidence in their operation. Oleg aims to develop mathematically grounded modeling languages, algorithms, and tools to verify system models in terms of their functional correctness and timeliness. He also develops methods for implementing systems according to their models.
