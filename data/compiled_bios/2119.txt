 Toggle navigation Bert Huang Home Research Teaching Hobbies Links Blog Bert Huang Assistant Professor of Computer Science bhuang@vt.edu About Me I am an assistant professor in the Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science. I investigate machine learning with a special focus on models and data with structure stemming from natural networks. Within this focus, my work addresses open questions on theory, algorithms, and applications. Interested students : I'm not currently admitting new students into my group, so I am not reading or replying to emails requesting to join. If you're interested in doing related research at Virginia Tech, see the many other faculty working in related areas. Research Machine Learning Laboratory I direct the Machine Learning Laboratory . We investigate machine learning for complex phenomena. Our research addresses challenges inherent in the modeling of the connected world. We focus on a balance of theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and applied research to advance knowledge on the entire spectrum of machine learning science.

Hobbies Music When I have free time, I try my best to be a musician. Lately, this is mostly manifested by my playing guitar to entertain my pet budgie. Recently, I created a few recordings experimenting with the electronic instruments built into Apple GarageBand for iPad, which can be streamed from my SoundCloud page. In my early high school years, I arranged a number of electronic pieces . Later, in high school and college, I explored combining my electronic songs with real voice and instrument recordings ( here is a small subset).
