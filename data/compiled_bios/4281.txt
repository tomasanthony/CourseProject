Hasan Davulcu Associate Professor Hasan Davulcu has done extensive research in data mining and information assurance. His previous works in the data and services integration were published at prestigious ACM and IEEE conferences. His paper titled CTR-S: A Logic for Specifying Contracts in Semantic Web Services was nominated for the Best Alternate Tracks Paper Award at the 13th International World Wide Web conference. Prior to joining ASU he was the VP of Technology at XSB Inc, a Long Island based software startup. At XSB Inc he was the PI for an NSF funded SBIR project whose goal was to empower end users (who are not computing professionals) to create structured knowledge from unstructured data. At ASU, Professor Davulcus research has been funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) prestigious early CAREER award, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) MURI award and US Department of Defense (DOD). He has authored or co-authored over 30 papers at major Web, database and data mining conferences and journals, and is the co-founder and acting CEO of an e-commerce ASU start-up named USuggest Corporation. hdavulcu@asu.edu 480-965-6385 BYENG 564 http://www.public.asu.edu/~hdavulcu/ Education Ph.D., Computer Science,State University of New York, 2002 M.S., Computer Science, Stony Brook University, 1995 B.S., Mathematics,Middle East Technical University, Turkey, 1993 Research interests Data mining, web and text mining, data cleaning and information extraction, workflows and semantic web services, database systems Honors and awards  NSF Career Award, 2007  Key activities  PC member, National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2007) PC Member, International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2007) Co-chair, Workshop on Information Integration on the Web PC member, National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2004)   January 3, 2018 CIDSE          Hasan Davulcu           Associate Professor  CASCADE , Co-Director  School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems  Engineering   Ira A.
