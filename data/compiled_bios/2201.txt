Teaching Fall 2015: CSE570: Wireless and Mobile Networking Not teaching currently Where I have been before I grew up in Serampore , a town in the Eastern part of India. I was educated at Jadavpur University (bachelors) in Kolkata , India, and at Indian Institute of Science (masters) in Bangalore , India. I got my PhD in computer science from Georgia Tech in Atlanta. I also worked briefly in Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. Prior to Stony Brook, I was a faculty member in Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio and then in Computer Engineering at University of Cincinnati .
