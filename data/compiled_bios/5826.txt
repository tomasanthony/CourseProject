The AdVanced Empirical Software Testing & Analysis (AVESTA) research group focuses on conducting research in various areas of software engineering including testing, empirical studies, and program analysis as well as many aspects of cybersecurity including security testing and security analysis.. The group was founded in the Department of Computer Science at Texas Tech University in August 2009. Test Current Research Projects Several research projects are active with their focus on the following areas: Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) on Determination of Skillsets of Professional Attackers/Defenders (A New NSF Funded Project, Funded September 2015) CyberExercises, Simulation-based Cybersecurity Training (An NSF Funded Project, Funded January 2015) Sonification of Security Cues (An NSF Funded Project, Funded September 2013) Keystroke Dynamics and Active User Authentication Cybersecurity & Security Testing: Adaptive Security Moving Target Defense Cybersecurity & Software Security: Automatic Generation of Cyber Attacks Past Research Projects This a short list of projects we have worked on in the past: Cybersecurity education (An NSG Funded Project, Funded September 2012) Statistical Fault Locatiozations Meta-Analysis Mutation Testing and Analysis The role of coverage on fault coverage Energy-aware Software Engineering Adaptive random testing. Testing multicore and multithreaded systems If you would like to know more information, please refer to the research page. Joining the Group The AVESTA group always welcomes motivated students to conduct research in several interesting areas of cybersecurity, software engineering and program analysis. In particular, the undergraduate and graduate students have the unique opportunity to benefit from learning applicable concepts while pursuing their theses/dissertations. Contact Dr. Akbar SiamiNamin for further information. Latest News: February 2013: Paper by Xiaozhen Xue and Akbar Siami Namin: "Measuring the Odds of Statements Being Faulty" is accepted for publication in the European Conference on Ada-Europe, Reliable Software Technology to be held in Berlin, 2013 Dr. Namin received recognition as a "most Influential Professor" in 2012 by honor students in Computer Science undergraduate program. Dr. Namin received funding from ACM and NSF to attend the Symposium on Software Engineering Education (SEES) in conjunction with FSE 2012 to be held in Cary, NC, USA Dr. Namin and Dr. Hewett received an NSF grant titled were awarded $266,648 by the National Science Foundation. The title of the proposal was "SFS: Capacity Building: Collaborative Project: Cyber-security Education for Community College Faculty in Texas." August 2012: Delbert Bonner successfully defended his Master's thesis: A Parallel Software Energy Efficient Ratio. Congratulations Delbert.
