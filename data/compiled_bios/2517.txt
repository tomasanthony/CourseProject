In June 2007 I obtained my Ph.D. in Engineering Science from theSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences, with a thesis entitled Information Theoretic Limits of Cooperation and Cognition in Wireless Networks. From July 2007 June 2008 I was a lecturer/post-doc at Harvard University, where I co-taughtAM21a and AM21b. From August December 2008, my husband Prof. Jakob Eriksson and I traveled the world. Our trip. In January 2009 I joined the ECE Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor. In August 2015 I became an Associate Professor. My research interests lie in multi-user information theory, cognitive radio channels, two-way communications and two-way information theory, applications of information theory to radar, and cooperation in wireless networks.
