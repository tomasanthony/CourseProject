 Qun Li Professor of Computer Science IEEE Fellow Publications Teaching ACM/IEEE HotWeb 2017 , San Jose, CA, 10/14/2017 I am a professor of Department of Computer Science at the College of William and Mary , and served as the graduate director of the department in 2010-2011. I got my PhD from Dartmouth College under the supervision of Daniela Rus . My recent research focuses on wireless, mobile, and embedded systems, including pervasive computing, smart phones, energy efficiency, smart grid, smart health, cognitive radio, wireless LANs, mobile ad-hoc networks, sensor networks, and RFID systems. It involves building and simulating prototype systems, and conducting real experiments and measurements. Check out our recent papers here . I am current working with brilliant PhD students Zhengrui Qin , Ed Novak , Nancy Carter , Zijiang Hao , and Yutao Tang. I am interested in motivated students who would like to work on operating systems, algorithms, networking, security and privacy in the context of pervasive, mobile, wireless computing systems. Recently PhD graduated: Fengyuan Xu, Wei Wei, Hao Han, Yifan Zhang. I am the recipient of a NSF Career Award and an IEEE Fellow. I am the Founder and Director of the Wireless Networking Laboratory . I have published more than 90 international journal articles, book chapters, conference/workshop papers, and technical reports. Many of them are published in prestigious conferences and journals in wireless networking systems and pervasive computing ( ICSE'16 , Ubicomp'15 , NSDI'13 , Mobisys'13 , Mobisys'12 , Ubicomp'13 , Pervasive'08 , Mobihoc'13 , Mobihoc'08 , Mobihoc'07 , Mobihoc'06 , Mobicom'03 , Mobicom'01 , Mobicom'00 , and Infocom'16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 09, 08, 06, 04). I was the program co-chair for IEEE Globecom Symposium of Next Generation Networking in 2011, IEEE ICCCN Track on Wireless Networks and Emerging Technologies in 2010, IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage in 2010, International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and Applications in 2007; student travel grant co-chair for IEEE Infocom in 2013, work-in-program track chair of DCOSS 2009, publication co-chair of IEEE Infocom in 2009, and financial co-chair of IEEE HPSR in 2008. I also served as TPC member for numerous conferences and workshops and on the editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. To add more information :-), my Erds number is 3.
