 R. Paul Wiegand R.PaulWiegand Home Academics Misc.Interests About Me: I work for the Institute for Simulation and Training at the University of Central Florida , and I hold a secondary joint appointment with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" . My area of interest is in developing empirical research and theory for understanding coadaptive learning algorithms for multiagent systems. In particular, in my dissertation I focused on using evolutionary game theory as a tool for understanding the dynamics of compositional (cooperative) coevolutionary algorithms. Recent Activities I teach CAP 5610 (Machine Learning) for the CS graduate program and DIG 5876 (Quantitative Aspects of Modeling & Simulation) for the Modeling and Simulation Program here at UCF I help manage the STOKES Advanced Research Computing Center I help organize Go Orlando , a local AGA chapter Annie Wu and I are gradually working to merge our two labs, the NCCS lab and the EC lab , here at UCF Publications, etc. My research My publications My dissertation My CV (PDF file) A Page on Tesseract!
