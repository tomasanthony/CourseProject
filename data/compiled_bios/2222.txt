He received his B.S. (1986) degree and his M.S. degree (1989) in Computer Science from Peking University in Beijing, China. He received his Ph.D. (1995) degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto. During 1989-1990, he was a researchscientist at North-China Institute of Computing Technologies. During 1990-1991, he was a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After he received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto in September 1995, he was a research scientist in Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto during September-December 1995. From December 1995 to 1997, he was an Assistant Professor of Computerand Information Science and Engineering at the University of Florida. From September 1997 to July 2001, he was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at State University of New York at Stony Brook. From August 2001 to July 2006, he was an Associate Professor (with tenure) at State University of New York at Stony Brook. He received the Honor Student Award from 1983 to 1986 and the Best Graduate Award in 1986 from Peking University. During his years at the University of Toronto (UofT), he received UofT Open Doctoral Fellowship. In 1997,Professor Qin was awarded NSF CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF). In September 2000, Professor Qin was awarded a newly-established NSF Information Technology Research (ITR) grant. In December 2000, Professor Qin received Honda Initiation Grant Award . In February 2001, Professor Qin was selected as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow by the Sloan Foundation . In September 2003, Professor Qin was awarded another NSF ITR grant. In June 2005, Professor Qin served as the general Co-Chair for Computer Graphics International 2005 (CGI'2005), and he was also the organizing committee chair for Stony Brook Graphics Week which includes Computer Graphics International 2005 (CGI'2005), Point-Based Graphics 2005 (PBG'2005), and Volume Graphics 2005 (VG'2005), held on June 20-24, 2005 in SUNY Stony Brook. Currently, he is an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEE TVCG), and he is also on the editorial board of The Visual Computer (International Journal of Computer Graphics). He is the Conference Co-Chair for ACM Solid and Physical Modeling Symposium 2007 (to be held at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China). He will be chairing Stony Brook Modeling Week (to be held in the week of June 2-6, 2008) in Stony Brook University .
