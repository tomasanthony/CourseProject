The Knights labmodels host-microbiome interactions in human disease, with labs in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Knights is a PI with the M innesota Supercomputing Institute. Knights Lab internal wiki Hacking the m icrobiome Hack ing [HAK- ing ] 1. Writingor refining computer programs skillfully. 2. Seeking and exploiting weaknesses in a complex system in order to change its behavior for one's benefit. Our computational microbiology lab develops methods that bringprecision medicine to the microbiome. We applythose methods to findpatterns in microbial communities that predict and diagnose human diseases.
