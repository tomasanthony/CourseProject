Robert Granger holds an MSci from the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol (2002) and a PhD from the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol (2006). He has held postdoctoral positions at: theCentre for Applied Cryptographic Research, University of Waterloo, Canada;his alma mater, again in theCryptography and Information Security Group;and at the Claude Shannon Institute, University College Dublin, Ireland. Before joiningthe University of Surrey as a Lecturer in Secure Systemsin December 2018,he was ascientist in theLaboratory for Cryptologic Algorithms, EPFL, Switzerland.I am a computational number theorist whose main specialism is the number-theoretic assumptions,applications and algorithms underlying public key cryptography. I have over a decade of experienceconceiving and leading often groundbreaking research projects in this area, and am an expert infoundational cryptographic security assumptions. In particular, I have designed several highly originaldiscrete logarithm algorithms for various algebraic groups (one receiving the Best Paper Award, CRYPTO 2013) and have set several world records for discrete logarithm computations with my teams. I have a natural passion for attacking interesting and hard problems (in cryptography and elsewhere), combining deep insights with powerful mathematical and computational techniques. In addition to cryptography and cryptanalysis, number theory, algebraic geometry, algorithm design, discrete mathematics and finite field theory, I am interested in various theoretical properties of irreducible polynomials and curves over finite fields.
