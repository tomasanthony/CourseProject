 Research Interests Dynamic analysis tools Software visualization Software engineering Education Bachelors of Science, The Ohio State University Masters of Science, Tufts University PhD, Tufts University Biography Mike Shah currently serves as an Assistant Teaching Professor at Northeastern University. While completing his Bachelor of Science at The Ohio State University, he was actively involved in teaching web development, 3D modeling, and game creation to students. His undergraduate research involved using gaming technology to train workers how to handle emergency epidemic scenarios. Shah completed his masters of science and PhD at Tufts University, and spent a great deal of time as a teaching assistant for courses including operating systems, algorithms, graphics, game design, HCI, and Data Structures. He also believes computer science is for everyone, and helped start a series of workshops for graduate students who had not programmed before. Shahs research activity has focused on building tools that make programmers lives easier. This includes building static analysis tools that can hint at bugs, and dynamic analysis tools (e.g. a profiler) that can report performance problems. Shah has also researched and built tools to visualize software to better help software engineers develop and manage large projects. Outside of academics, Shah runs, rock climbs, plays the guitar, and enjoys playing games. Courses taught: CS1802: Discrete Mathematics CS5340: Human Computer Interaction CS3650: Computer Systems :
