His research spans programming languages and compilers, software engineering, computer security, deep learning and education technologies. His work has received an ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award, a Google Scholar Classic Paper (2017) Award, best/distinguished paper awards at top venues (PLDI, OOPSLA, EAPLS, TACAS, ISSTA, ICSE x 2), an ACM CACM Research Highlight, an NSF CAREER Award, a UC Davis Outstanding Engineering Faculty Award, and multiple industrial faculty awards (Cisco, Google x 2, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla). He serves on the steering committees of ISSTA and ESEC/FSE, served as an Associate Editor for ACM TOSEM, co-chaired SAS 2009, program chaired ISSTA 2012, and program co-chaired SIGSOFT FSE 2016. He frequently serves on program committees of major venues (such as ICSE, FSE, ISSTA, PLDI, POPL, OOPSLA, and CAV). His PhD/postdoctoral students also received much recognition, including a SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award, a SIGSOFT Outstanding Dissertation Award and a UC Davis Zuhair A. Munir Best Dissertation Award; they assumed tenure-track positions at major research universities (e.g., Singapore Management University, University College London, Georgia Tech, Waterloo), R&D positions at major companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tencent, and Visa Research), and scientific/technical leadership positions at successful early-stage companies (e.g., Viv Labs). last modified: 2019.02.16
