Laboratory packages are aids that provide researchers with a driving research question, a methodology for designing and executing a study, tools and resources to replicate the study, and results of previous related studies. The cohorts will have a more-focused interaction during a summer session to develop a study with a follow-up workshop to report and discuss results. Finally, the tutorials allow for broader dissemination of the key concepts of empirical CSEd research to the larger community. Game Design Research Group (Co-Director) Our group of 13 students currently performs research on gamification in education and games for good. Our ongoing projects include a gamification platform for college courses, educational games for elementary and middle school students, and the creation of an introductory CS course that focuses on game design principles.
