At KTH, I was involved in two European projects under EU-FP7 grants,TRADRandRECONFIG.For my doctoral research, I worked atCERN(European Organization for Nuclear Research), Switzerland, conducting research in mobile robotics and received my Ph.D. (Robotics and Automation) fromUniversidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain in Oct 2014. My Ph.D. thesis titled"Wireless communication enhancement methods for mobile robots in radiation environments"was on teleoperated mobile robots for radiation survey applications at CERN. I was part of the EU-ITN projectPURESAFEas a Marie-Curie Early State Researcher. I had developed tools for optimizing and predicting wireless communication in mobile robots applied in hostile environmental conditions. While at CERN, I also led a part of the Robotic Train project (TIM - Train Inspection Monorail) for conducting radiation inspections at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
