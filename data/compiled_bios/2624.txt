 Home Publication Research Teaching and Outreach Software and Openings Chee Wei Tan Curriculum Vitae Email: cheewtan [at] cityu.edu.hk Office: Academic Bldg 1, G7307, Tel: (852) 3442 7652 Dr. Tan is an Associate Professor of Computer Science. He received the M.A and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University . He is a Senior Fellow of the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) for the program on Science at Extreme Scales. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the NetLab Group of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and worked at Fraser Research Lab and Qualcomm R&D (QRC). He is currently serving as an Editor for the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking . His research interests include networks and graph analytics, algorithms at the interface of computer science and statistics, artificial intelligence, convex optimization theory, and innovations in computer science and mathematics education. His Erds number is 3 . Three different three-hop paths: C. W. Tan A. R. Calderbank J. H. Spencer Paul Erds C. W. Tan S. Friedland H. Minc Paul Erds C. W. Tan H.-L. Fu C. J. Colbourn Paul Erds The Erds number is an example of a network of people, and Dr. Tan's current research on network science explores the mathematics and algorithms of web analytics and artificial intelligence. Dr. Tan received the Princeton University Wu Prize for Excellence and was twice selected to participate at the U.S. National Academy of Engineering China-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. His research has been featured in Hong Kong Research Grants Council's Research Frontiers . He has previously served as the Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Communications and the Chairman of the IEEE Information Theory Society Hong Kong Chapter receiving the 2015 IT Society Chapter of the Year award. He organizes the Computer Science Challenge for high school students to learn computer science and advanced mathematics. Recent Publication P.-D. Yu, C. W. Tan and H.-L.
