Previously, he was a research associate at Realistic Graphics and Imaging Group , Imperial College London (ICL), UK from 2017 - 2018. His primary research interest lies in modeling material appearances and surface geometric phenomena. He has a keen interest in inter-disciplinary research involving visual computing, especially in material fabrication. His association with ICL began as a visiting researcher (2016 - 2017) on a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) fellowship for a post-doc position. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from University of Bern , Switzerland (2011-2015). His PhD thesis On Modeling and Simulating Reptile Skin Coloration was an inter-disciplinary research work in collaboration with biologists and physicists at University of Geneva , Switzerland. Dr. Dhillon obtained his M.Sc. (Engg.) degree with a research thesis on structured-light 3D scanning systems, from Indian Institute of Science (2007-2010) and a bachelor degree in computer engineering from University of Mumbai (1995-1999). Apart from an academic research background in computer graphics and vision, he has eight years of industrial experience in software development (1999-2007), including research in video encoders and speaker verification using Hidden Markov Models.

SIGGRAPH ASIA) 37, 6, Article 272, 16 pages. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275077 , * joint first authors We present two novel and complimentary approaches to measure diffraction effects in commonly found planar spatially varying holographic surfaces. Such surfaces are increasingly found in various decorative materials such as gift bags, holographic papers, clothing and security holograms, and produce impressive visual effects that have not been previously acquired for realistic rendering. Such holographic surfaces are usually manufactured with one dimensional diffraction gratings that are varying in periodicity and orientation over an entire sample in order to produce a wide range of diffraction effects such as gradients and kinematic (rotational) effects. Our proposed methods estimate these two parameters and allow an accurate reproduction of these effects in real-time. The first method simply uses a point light source to recover both the grating periodicity and orientation in the case of regular and stochastic textures. Under the assumption that the sample is made of the same repeated diffractive tile, good results can be obtained using just one to five photographs on a wide range of samples. The second method is based on polarization imaging and enables an independent high resolution measurement of the grating orientation and relative periodicity at each surface point. The method requires a minimum of four photographs for accurate results, does not assume repetition of an exemplar tile, and can even reveal minor fabrication defects. We present point light source renderings with both approaches that qualitatively match photographs, as well as real-time renderings under complex environmental illumination. Bifurcation Analysis of Reaction Diffusion Systems on Arbitrary Surfaces Dhillon, D.S., Milinkovitch, M.C., and Zwicker, M. (2017), in Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 79: 788827 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-017-0255-8 In this paper, we present computational techniques to investigate the effect of surface geometry on biological pattern formation. In particular, we study twocomponent, nonlinear reactiondiffusion (RD) systems on arbitrary surfaces. We build on standard techniques for linear and nonlinear analysis of RD systems and extend them to operate on large-scale meshes for arbitrary surfaces. In particular, we use spectral techniques for a linear stability analysis to characterise and directly compose patterns emerging from homogeneities. We develop an implementation using surface finite element methods and a numerical eigenanalysis of the LaplaceBeltrami operator on surface meshes. In addition, we describe a technique to explore solutions of the nonlinear RD equations using numerical continuation. Here, we present a multiresolution approach that allows us to trace solution branches of the nonlinear equations efficiently even for large-scale meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the working of our framework for two RD systems with applications in biological pattern formation: a Brusselator model that has been used to model pattern development on growing plant tips, and a chemotactic model for the formation of skin pigmentation patterns. While these models have been used previously on simple geometries, our framework allows us to study the impact of arbitrary geometries on emerging patterns. Interactive Diffraction from Biological Nanostructures Dhillon, D.S., Teyssier, J., Single, M., Gaponenko, I., Milinkovitch, M.C., and Zwicker, M. (2014), in Computer Graphics Forum (Vol. 33, No. 8, pp. 177-188), orally presented at Eurographics 2015, Zurich DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12425 We describe a technique for interactive rendering of diffraction effects produced by biological nanostructures, such as snake skin surface gratings. Our approach uses imagery from atomic force microscopy that accurately captures the geometry of the nanostructures responsible for structural colouration, that is, colouration due to wave interference, in a variety of animals. We develop a rendering technique that constructs bidirectional reflection distribution functions (BRDFs) directly from the measured data and leverages pre-computation to achieve interactive performance. We demonstrate results of our approach using various shapes of the surface grating nanostructures. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of our pre-computation-based technique and compare to a reference BRDF construction technique. Geometric and Radiometric Estimation in a Structured-light 3D Scanner Dhillon, D.S., and Govindu, V.M. (2015), in Machine Vision and Applications, 26(2-3), 339-352 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-015-0667-0 The key problems in a structured-light 3D scanner using a projector and camera are its geometric and radiometric calibration. A projector can be effectively represented using the familiar pin-hole model for cameras. However, since we cannot directly observe the projector plane, it cannot be calibrated like a camera. The first contribution of our paper is to develop a geometric calibration and 3D estimation method that utilises the projective geometric relationships available in a projectorcamera pair, i.e., homography induced by a plane and invariance of cross-ratios. The low-dimensional parametric form of the homography averages out individual errors, resulting in a geometric calibration approach that is both simple to use and highly accurate. We present an extensive set of results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and also characterise its accuracy. Second, we present a method for correcting systematic errors introduced due to the radiometric non-linearities present in commercial projectors. These errors are pronounced when only a few phase shifts are used in the sinusoidal coding scheme for structured-light scanners. We develop a cubic spline-based method to model and remove the effects due to these non-linearities. The efficacy of our model is demonstrated on real datasets. Crocodile Head Scales Are Not Developmental Units But Emerge from Physical Cracking Milinkovitch, M.C., Manukyan, L., Debry, A., Di-Po, N., Martin, S., Singh, D., Lambert, D., and Zwicker, M. (2013), in Science, 339(6115), 78-81 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1226265 Various lineages of amniotes display keratinized skin appendages (feathers, hairs, and scales) that differentiate in the embryo from genetically controlled developmental units whose spatial organization is patterned by reaction-diffusion mechanisms (RDMs). We show that, contrary to skin appendages in other amniotes (as well as body scales in crocodiles), face and jaws scales of crocodiles are random polygonal domains of highly keratinized skin, rather than genetically controlled elements, and emerge from a physical self-organizing stochastic process distinct from RDMs: cracking of the developing skin in a stress field. We suggest that the rapid growth of the crocodile embryonic facial and jaw skeleton, combined with the development of a very keratinized skin, generates the mechanical stress that causes cracking.
