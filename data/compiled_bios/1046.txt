 Mark Herbster Associate Professor Department of Computer Science University College London 66 Gower Street (room 302) London WC1E 6BT United Kingdom M.Herbster@cs.ucl.ac.uk Phone: +44 (0)20 3108 7091 Fax: +44 (0)20 7387 1397 Research: My research currently largely focuses on the problem of predicting a labeling of a graph. This problem is foundational for transductive and semi-supervised learning. I am also broadly interested in online learning, see my publications page for more details. I am affiliated with Centre for Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) Publications: Teaching: I am programme director for the MSc in Machine Learning (formerly Intelligent Systems). Machine learning is a sub-discipline of computer science which studies the process of automatic inference from data. This field draws on ideas and methods from a diversity of perspectives and disciplines such as artificial intelligence, connectionism, optimization, pattern recognition, and statistics. The commercial successes of machine learning are widespread, some well-known examples are in speech recognition, robotic vision, online ad-placement, fraud detection, and bioinformatics. The MSc Machine Learning is aimed at students trained in computer science or another quantitative science. This MSc is designed to train the student in both the practical and theoretical sides of machine learning and is aimed to prepare the student for either an industrial career or for PhD study. I encourage you to contact me if you should have any questions about this MSc.
