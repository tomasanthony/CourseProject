Ron Fedkiw (Full) Professor Stanford Computer Science Ph.D. Applied Mathematics, UCLA LEFT PHOTO: circa 2005; RIGHT PHOTO: circa 2017 Computer Science Department Stanford University Gates Computer Science Bldg., Room 207 Stanford, CA 94305-9020 fedkiw@cs.stanford.edu Hollywood Special Effects via Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Physical Simulation These days my work on special effects focuses quite a bit on face and body animation and simulation, trying to outwit the uncanny valley. Traditionally, one used only computer vision techniques for this sort of work, but we're now successfully mixing in quite a bit of physical simulation as well. We have many ongoing projects mixing in real world data and simulation in order to create more realistic Hollywood special effects (cloth is next). CS205L: Continuous Mathematical Methods with an Emphasis on Machine Learning A survey of numerical approaches to the continuous mathematics used in computer vision and robotics with emphasis on machine and deep learning. Although motivated from the standpoint of machine learning, the course will focus on the underlying mathematical methods including computational linear algebra and optimization, as well as special topics such as automatic differentiation via backward propagation, momentum methods from ordinary differential equations, CNNs, RNNs, etc. (Replaces CS205A, and satisfies all similar requirements.) Prerequisites: Math 51; Math 104 or 113 or equivalent or comfort with the associated material. Brief Bio Fedkiw received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from UCLA and spent part of his postdoctoral studies at Caltech in Aeronautics before joining the Stanford Computer Science Department. He was awarded an Academy Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (twice: 2008 and 2015), the National Academy of Science Award for Initiatives in Research, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), a Sloan Research Fellowship, the ACM Siggraph Significant New Researcher Award, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program Award (ONR YIP), the Okawa Foundation Research Grant, the Robert Bosch Faculty Scholarship, the Robert N. Noyce Family Faculty Scholarship, two distinguished teaching awards, etc. He has published over 120 research papers in computational physics, graphics, and vision, a book on level set methods, and is currently working at the interface between physical simulation and machine learning - recently joining the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). Currently, he serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Computational Physics. For the past 18 years, he has been a consultant with Industrial Light + Magic, receiving screen credits on movies such as "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines", "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith", "Poseidon", "Evan Almighty", "Kong: Skull Island", etc. Of all his achievements, he is most proud of the combined accomplishments of the 30 Ph.D. students that he has graduated so far, and looks forward to seeing what the next 30 will do!

Personally, I have always been amazed that academics who devote their lives to producing new information actually work to censure and diminish the work produced by others, and often take pride in doing just that. As time goes on, one learns to distinguish between those in academia who love the work and those that have instead turned academia into some sort of career aggressively optimizing their stature at the expense of the community as a whole. For young researchers this can be quite daunting, but I strongly encourage you to stick to your ideas and goals and the pursuit of what interests you. Remember, the content of your paper and the value of its ideas are not diminished because it was rejected from your preferred venue. The content of the paper itself does not change because of the name of the journal printed on the upper corner of the page! To emphasize this, I decided to list my 3 most cited REJECTED papers along with their google scholar citation counts: "A Boundary Condition Capturing Method for Multiphase Incompressible Flow", 646 citations, rejected from J.
