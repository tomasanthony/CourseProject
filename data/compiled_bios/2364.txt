I am a Professor in Computational Intelligence, Head of the Nature Inspired Computing and Engineering (NICE) group, Co-Coordinator of the Centre for Mathematical and Computational Biology (CMCB), Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey. I was a Finland Distinguished Professor (2015-17) with the Industrial Optimization Group, Department of Mathematical Information, University of Jyvaskyla, Finland, and a Changjiang Distinguished Visiting Professor (2015-17), State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, China.I am the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems and Co-Editor-in-Chief of Complex & Intelligent Systems (Springer). I was an elected AdCom member (2012-2013), Vice President for Technical Activities (2014-2015), and an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer (2013-2015, 2017-2019) of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. I was elevated to an IEEE Fellow for contributions to evolutionary optimization.I obtained the BSc, MSc and PhD degrees from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China and the Dr.-Ing. from Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. Before joining Surrey in 2010, I was a Principal Scientist with Honda Research Institute Europe, Germany. I did postdoctoral research with the Industrial Engineering Department, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, USA from 1998 to 1999. I was an Assistant and Associate Professor with the Electrical Engineering Department, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China from 1992 to 1996.I am an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Nanobioscience, Soft Computing (Springer), and BioSystems (Elsevier). I am also an Editorial Board Member of the Evolutionary Computation Journal (MIT Press) and Natural Computing (Springer). I am a past Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, and the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development, and IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine.I am a Member of EPSRC Peer Review College and EPSRC ICT Responsive Mode Panel, a Panel Member of EC FP7 FET/HBP grants, a Panel Review Member of Academy of Finland and a Reviewer of VQR (Research Assessment), Italy.I am the General Co-Chair of the 2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI 2016), Founding General Co-Chair of the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Big Data, IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Multi-Criterion Decision-Making (IEEE MCDM), IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (IEEE CIDUE). I was General Chair of 2012IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (IEEE CIBCB 2012) and Program Chair of 2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation.02.05.17Read more13.10.16Read more11.02.15Read moreMy science-driven research interests lie in interdisciplinary areas that bridge the gap between computational intelligence and machine learning, computational neuroscience, and computational biology.
