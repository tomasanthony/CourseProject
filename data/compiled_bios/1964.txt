 Toggle navigation Erik Sudderth News Group Projects Papers Courses Erik B. Sudderth, Statistical Computation & Perception I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine . I previously spent seven great years on the faculty at Brown University , where I remain an Adjunct Associate Professor of Computer Science . My Learning, Inference, & Vision Group develops statistical methods for scalable machine learning, with applications in artificial intelligence, vision, and the natural and social sciences. Particular areas of expertise include: Machine Learning graphical models, Bayesian nonparametrics, approximate inference Computer Vision object recognition & scene understanding, segmentation, motion & tracking Signal Processing nonlinear dynamical systems, image & video analysis, multiscale models See my CVPR tutorial for an overview of Bayesian nonparametrics in computer vision. For a tutorial introduction to probabilistic modeling and approximate inference, see the background chapter of my doctoral thesis , advised by Professors Alan Willsky and William Freeman at MIT EECS . My postdoctoral research at Berkeley EECS was advised by Professors Michael Jordan and Stuart Russell .

I gave a talk at the 2017 SoCal Machine Learning Symposium about our earlier diverse particle max-product algorithm, which gives state-of-the-art predictions of continuous protein side-chain conformations. Code available . At AISTATS 2018 , our framework for prediction-constrained training of probabilistic models leads to improved semi-supervised learning of topic models, with applications to the analysis of documents and electronic health records. This work received the SoCal NLP Symposium best paper award . Our work on latent support surfaces for semantic 3D scene understanding , which uses contextual cues to detect objects in RGB-D images , appears at CVPR 2018 . Work with BrainGate on multiscale semi-Markov dynamics for improved brain-computer interfaces appeared at NIPS 2017 . A supplemental video demonstrates accurate, interactive control of a computer cursor by a clinical trial participant with tetraplegia. Our open source toolbox BNPy: Bayesian Nonparametric clustering for Python implements scalable, stochastic and memoized variational inference algorithms. Read about applications to HDP topic models at AI & Statistics 2015 , to HDP hidden Markov models at NIPS 2015 , and to patch-based models for natural image processing at ICML 2017 . The 2014 ISBA Mitchell Prize for Bayesian analysis of an important applied problem goes to our NET-VISA system for global seismic monitoring , learned from data provided by the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization (CTBTO) . For details see the Brown University news article . An NSF CAREER Award supports my work on large-scale Bayesian nonparametric learning. Weiss & Pearl introduce our review article on Nonparametric Belief Propagation for the CACM .
