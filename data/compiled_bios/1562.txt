We combine machine learning techniques and high-throughput assays. Focusing on transcription factors (TFs) that control cell proliferation and differentiation, our goals are to understand: (1) how these regulatory proteins interact with each other to select their unique targets across the genome, and (2) how this regulation is disrupted in diseased cells due to non-coding mutations and TF overexpression. Learn more Check out our new iMADS web server. It includes quantitative models of specificity and differential specificity for human TFs, easy-to-access genome-wide predictions, and an online tool to make predictions for custom sequences.
