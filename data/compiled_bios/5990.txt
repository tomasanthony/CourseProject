Shaw & Co. (1998-99); Professor, UBC (2001-); Keywords theoretical computer science explicit constructions graph eignvalues and expansion Interests My research focuses on graph eigenvalues and expansion and their connections to other fields. These other fields are quite numerous, and include error correcting codes, nonblocking networks, differential geometry, number theory, mathematical physics concerning eigenvalues of random structures, etc. Selected Publications Joel Friedman, "A Proof of Alon's Second Eigenvalue Conjecture and Related Problems,'' Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society, 2008, no. 910.
