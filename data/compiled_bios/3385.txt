Full Text Research Research Overview Iris Bahar's research interests lie broadly in the areas of computer architecture, electronic design automation, and digital circuit design. In particular, she is working on developing new approaches to reduce power dissipation and improve reliability in high-performance processors, including embedded multiprocessors and nanocomputing systems. In addition, she is working on methods to improve the accuracy of timing analyzers used for verifying circuits designs.Her recent interests have led her to consider robotic system design, and how these systems can benefit from energy-efficient design techniques. Research Statement The following is a summary of some of Dr. Bahar's reserch projects: Energy Efficient Transactional Memory Techniques for Embedded Architectures Because many embedded devices run on batteries, energy efficiency is perhaps the single most important criterion for evaluating hardware and software effectiveness in embedded devices. In this project, we are developing energy-efficient implementations using transactional memory on an embedded platform. Most recently, we have explored how the transactional memory framework can be used to support error recovery caused by aggressive use of voltage over-scaling. We also explored implementing more effect memory allocation methods that may be used on top of transactional memory.This work is being supported by NSF. Concurrent Processing-in-Memory Architectures A Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture consists of one or more simple processors each with its own memory. PIM modules are best viewed as accelerators , providing powerful yet specialized enhancements to existing systems running existing software. This project has the dual aim of adapting highly-concurrent data structures to PIM architectures, and of adapting PIM architectures to the needs of todays concurrent software. Modeling Thermal Noise Effects in Nanoscale Circuits and Designing Noise Tolerant Circuits Electrical noise will play an increasingly critical role in future nanoscale CMOS circuit operation characterized by lower supply voltages and smaller device sizes. Both of these downscaling approaches reduce the margin of immunity to thermal noise, alpha particle strikes, and threshold voltage variations. This project investigates noise effects in electronic circuits. Recently, we have beendeveloping new modeling techniques to capture transient noise effects due to thermal and RTS noise.The project also explores new approaches for noise-immune circuit design. This work is being supported by NSF. Robust Robot Perception The goal of this project is to implement new algorithms in hardware and software to support accurate and energy-efficient robot perception. In particular, perception is a critical capability to enable purposeful goal-directed manipulation for autonomous robots. Object detection and recognition techniques used for robot perception have greatly improved over the past few years. However, these improvements have often come at the expense of significant energy consumption and computational inefficiency. In order to achieve real-time energy-efficient computing for these autonomous robots, we need to rethink not just the perception algorithms themselves, but also how they are implemented in hardware and the computational resources allocated to their execution. Building Design Exploration and Analysis Tool for Vision-based Robotic Systems The goal of this project is to implement a modeling framework for the development of specialized system-on-chip (SoC) modules for lightweight autonomous senor-based robotic systems. Such a tool will be able to guide in the design of architectures for general purpose processors and graphics processors as well as dedicated or reconfigurable hardware modules optimized to meet the specific performance and system requirements of the robotic system. Initial funding for thiswork was provided through a Brown SEED grant. Techniques for Built-in Self-Repair in 3D Die Stacks Using Programmable Logic Three-dimensional stacked integrated circuits (ICs) hold much promise for increasing system performance. However, they are also difficult to test and assemble, leading to yield issues. This project investigates the use of unused resources within the 3D stack to replace defective portions of a die. In particular, we are exploring techniques for error detection, different levels of granularity for replacement, and optimal use of reconfigurable logic to repair the errors. This work has received support from NSF.
