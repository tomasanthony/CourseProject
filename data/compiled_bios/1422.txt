Binary Analysis - Luxembourg from Abhik Roychoudhury Reflection " Education consists mostly of what we have unlearned" - Mark Twain "There is no joy in the finite. There is joy only in the infinite." - Upanishads. ---> What can you infer by combining the above two statements? And here is one of my favorites "If you shut the door to all errors, truth will be shut out." - Rabindranath Tagore. ---> In formal verification - we establish truth of a property in a model by shutting out all errors!
