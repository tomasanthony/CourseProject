My undergraduate and graduate education was at MIT , where I was fortunate to have Piotr Indyk as my advisor. After graduating in 2013, I was a postdoc at the Simons Institute in Berkeley and at the IBM Almaden Research Center before arriving at UT in Fall 2014. ( CV ) Research I am broadly interested in algorithms and lower bounds. I particularly focus on really efficient algorithms as inputs get larger, even quadratic algorithms are typically too slow. We would like our algorithms to take nearly linear or even sublinear time and space. Sublinear algorithms are tricky, though you can't even read or store the whole input. Much of my research has focused on compressive sensing and sparse recovery, where you want to estimate a vector from a small linear "sketch" of it. One important subtopic is sparse Fourier transforms, where we showed how to estimate the Fourier transform in less time than the FFT for sparse data. Another aspect of my research is lower bounds. For many of the above problems and other statistical problems, we can achieve matching (or nearly matching) lower bounds on the sample complexity or space complexity. This lets us know when to stop looking for better algorithms, and to instead look for better problems. Teaching Spring 2019: Honors introduction to algorithms (CS 331H) .
