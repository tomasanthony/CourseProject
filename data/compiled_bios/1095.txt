I am currently head of the group. My research area is real-time interactive virtual environments, with particular interest in virtual reality, augmented reality, novel forms of interaction, large-scale graphical models, collaborative systems and networking for tightly synchronous telecollaboration. The group runs a CAVE-like facility , a large tracking spaceand several other high-end virtual reality systems. Details of my active projects can be found here . I am first supervisorfor several doctoral students David Walton, Cristina Amati, Ben Congdon and Daniele Giunchi. I have three post-doctoral fellows, Sebastian Friston and Drew MacQuarrie .My teaching responsibilities can be found here . I am currently deputy head of department. I was director of the Engineering Doctorate Centre in Virtual Environment, Imaging and Visualisation from 2005- 2013 and 2014-2018. Previously I was responsible for external relations for the department and I remain active in a number of technology transfer initiatives. I also consult to a small number of companies in areas related to graphics or new media. I was afounder and board member ofASIO Ltd,creators of Chirp . See personal pages about me.
