 Patrick Totzke About Publications Teaching Links Hey there! I am a theoretical computer scientist by day, based in sunny Liverpool where I am a member of the Verification Group . Our department is offering two fully funded PhD positions . Get in touch if you are interested in doing a PhD with me. The Deadline for these is Friday, March 1st, 2019 . Research Interests I am interested in all things logics, automata, game theory and computer-aided verification. Most of my published work is on infinite-state models and includes extensions of vector addition systems with data, pushdown stack, alternation or branching. These days, I mostly focus on timed automata and (stochastic) games played on graphs. A list of my publications is available here and on the dblp . Short Bio I joined Liverpool's Department of Computer science as a lecturer in 2018. Before that, I did postdocs at the LFCS in Edinburgh (2016-2018) and spend a year each at the University of Warwick (2015) and LaBRI in Bordeaux (2014), where I had the pleasure of working with Ranko Lazi , Jrme Leroux , Grgoire Sutre and Richard Mayr . I hold a PhD from the University of Edinburgh and a diploma (Dipl. Inf.) from the University of Hamburg where I grew up. Misc In my spare time I attempt to play the trumpet, enjoy cooking and maintain a healthy appreciation of good whisky. I am overly passionate about free software . I have a ha-index of 80.
