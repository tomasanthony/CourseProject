Saks-K. Hildrum-B. Y. Zhao)           This page, circa 2011          I am Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago.      My research covers a range of topics from large-distributed     networks and systems, HCI, security and     privacy, and wireless / mobile systems, mostly from a data-driven perspective.  My current projects     are focused on three areas: data-driven models of user behavior/interactions,      security of online and mobile communities, and     wireless systems and protocols. My work targets a range of top      conferences, including WWW/IMC, UsenixSecurity/NDSS/S&P/CCS, CHI/CSCW, and Mobicom/SIGCOMM/NSDI. Here\'s a wordle of my     paper abstracts from 2017-2018.        Together with Prof. Heather Zheng, I co-direct the SAND      Lab (Systems, Algorithms, Networking and Data) at University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2004, where I was advised by         John Kubiatowicz          and Anthony Joseph, and created the Tapestry distributed hash table (dissertation). I received my MS from Berkeley in 2000, and my BS in computer science from Yale in 1997.  I am an ACM Distinguished Scientist, a recipient of the National Science Foundation\'s CAREER award (2005), MIT Tech Review\'s TR-35 Award (Young Innovators Under 35) (2006), IEEE Internet Technical Committee\'s Early Career Award (2014), and one          of ComputerWorld\'s Top 40 Technology Innovators under 40.  My papers have somewhere around 26,000 citations and  an H-index of 63 (for whatever that\'s worth). Teaching Winter 2019: M/W 2:00-3:20PM, Saieh (SHFE) 021, CS 23280/Econ 23040 (Cryptocurrencies), a new course co-taught with David Cash (CS) and Harald Uhlig (Economics). This course will cover both the computer science aspects and economic aspects of cryptocurrencies. Topics to be discussed will include network and system building blocks, consensus protocols, cryptographic algorithms, security and privacy issues, pricing of cryptocurrencies, bubbles, monetary policy issues and regulatory concerns. Winter 2019: Tu/Th 11AM-12:20AM, Hinds (HGS) 180, CS 35401 (Special Topics/Seminar: Applied  Machine Learning). We will cover recent research in applied machine learning and  systems, particularly with respect to questions of robustness and resilience against  attacks on deep learning systems. Students will present papers, lead discussion, and run  open ended projects related to the topic. Press/Media A collection of recent news and media coverage of our research is here. Active data mining/OSN project pages: Clickstream behavior models,  Graph Coordinate Systems, Graph Modeling/Generation, Social Network Measurement/Analysis, Detection of Social Spam and Fake Users (Sybils)     I\'m always looking for bright PhD students!! I\'m always interested in self-driven/passionate students who want to work on high impact projects and have fun doing it.   UChicago is a fantastic place to do a PhD, and we\'re constantly making  improvements. To find out a bit more about me as an advisor, and my  views on everything from students to research and the meaning of life, you can read some of my posts on Quora, where I\'ve been "Top  Writer" since 2014.  Email me to get on my radar, and mention me (or Heather) in your application. I read all my emails. But due to the volume of these requests, I might not be  able to reply to your email.     UChicago Undergraduates interested in research?     I generally advise 1-3 undergraduates in my lab in active     research (we have 6 already in 2017-8). If you\'re interested in working in my lab as an      undergrad, drop by my lab at 203A Searle     and we\'ll talk!  Generally speaking, the best way to join my lab     as an undergrad is to take     and do well in my courses in networking or applied ML,          Copyright  SAND Lab, UChicago  css design: Luka Cvrk.The SAND Lab is grateful for research support from DARPA, NSF,  Google, Cisco, HP labs, Amazon and NVidia.
