Mark Crovella is a full Professor and former Chair in the Department of Computer Science at Boston University, where he has been since 1994. He also currently serves as Chief Scientist of Guavus, Inc. During 2003-2004 he was a Visiting Associate Professor at the Laboratoire dInfomatique de Paris VI (LIP6). His research interests center on improving the understanding, design, and performance of networks and networked computer systems, mainly through the application of data mining, statistics, and performance evaluation. He has made contributions to understanding the Internet and World Wide Web, social networks, and biological networks. Professor Crovella is co-author of Internet Measurement: Infrastructure, Traffic, and Applications (Wiley Press, 2006) and is the author of over two hundred papers on networking and computer systems, with over 20,000 citations (Google Scholar). He holds nine patents deriving from his research. Between 2007 and 2009 he was Chair of ACM SIGCOMM. He is co-author of Self-Similarity in World Wide Web Traffic: Evidence and Possible Causes, which received the 2010 ACM SIGMETRICS Test of Time Award, and of Routing State Distance: A Path-Based Metric for Network Analysis, which won a 2013 IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize.
