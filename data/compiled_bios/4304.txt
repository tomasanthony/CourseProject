Yoshihiro Kobayashi Lecturer Yoshihiro Kobayashi received a Ph.D. degree with a major in Architecture on Design Computation and a minor in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2001. After completing the program, he worked at Arizona State Universitys School of Architecture for 8 years teaching a series of courses on computer programming languages including 2-D/3-D application development, information management, algorithmic design, and fabrications. At ASU, he completed several interdisciplinary research projects funded more than $100K and advised M.S. and Ph.D. students from architecture, urban planning, design and art, electric engineering, and computer science programs. Outside of ASU, Kobayashi has chaired several symposiums and workshops and also organized an international research group with sixteen professors who are exploring methods for virtual reality (VR) urban modeling and visualization. He has published more than 50 technical and design papers on design computation in architecture. Kobayashi currently teaches game development courses as a focal coordinator for the Game Certificate program at CIDSE. ykobaya@asu.edu 480-965-3708 BYENG 354 http://www.yoshikobayashi.com Research interests Game design, game development, digital fabrication, AI in design, virtual reality, building information modeling, procedural modeling, computer graphics, PRISM Lab at ASU Honors and awards  IFC Award at Build Live Tokyo 2010 Technical Award, 7th VR Simulation Contest 2008 Honorable Judge Award, 6th VR Simulation Contest 2007 Best Award on CG Animation, JAPAN CG Grand Prix 1994 SANAE Prize, Waseda University, 1994 Best Graduate Essay Award in Dep. of Arch., Waseda Univ, 1992    May 18, 2016 CIDSE          Dr. Yoshihiro Kobayashi Science of Designing      Top Blog Profile CV Teaching Philosophy Research Interests Reference Publication ArtGallery Download                             Game Development  requires a skill set of both professional 3D modeling & animation, and senior level programming. My specialty is on procedural modeling in MaxScript and on game development in Unity.     Projection Mapping  is one of the hot media art projects to project digital contents on real 3d objects such as buildings, sculpture, and nature. I am involved in the Projection Mapping Association in Japan, and joined the Zushi Media Art Festival 2012.     Procedural Architectural Modeling  is one of the scientific research topics in 3d graphics. I have been involved in several funded projects and published technical papers on the topic. Refer to the Siggraph Asia 2011       Architecture  I designed several buildings and houses in Japan as a freelance architect. I also worked at the architecture firm: Architect Yoshiro Ikehara, who is one of the National Member of Art in Japan.     VR and Simulation  on urban and city issues need a wide interdisciplinary  knowlege. The World16 is a world-wide research group to propose future SIM & VIZ  tools on Flood, Traffics, Energy, and building information modeling (BIM). Refere to the World16 Web page.     AI and Image Processing  is my dissertation topic. I am interested in using AI technologies such as neural networks, Genetic algorithm, fuzzy systems and image processing in practical design process.
