Home Courses Publications Blog Group Members News Ulas Bagci, Ph.D., Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Faculty Member, Center for Research in Computer Vision University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL More Info Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Prof. Bagci is a faculty member at the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV), and the Assistant Professor in University of Central Florida (UCF). His research interests are Artificial intelligence, machine learning and their applications in biomedical and clinical imaging. Previously, he was a staff scientist and the lab co-manager at the NIH's Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI) Lab, department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS). At NIH, Prof. Bagci has developed and implemented educational and scientific research initiatives, and mentored postdoctoral and postbaccalaureate fellows for quantitative image analysis in clinical and pre-clinical projects at the Clinical Center. Prof. Bagci had also been the leading scientist (image analyst) in biosafety/bioterrorism project initiated jointly by NIAID and IRF. Prof. Bagci obtained his PhD degree from School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham (UK) in collaboration with Radiology department of University of Pennsylvania (with Prof. Udupa, MIPG). He has masters from Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and certificates of mastery from statistics, public health, and clinical trials. Prof. Bagci is senior member of IEEE and RSNA, and member of scientific organizations such as Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), American Statistical Association (ASA), Royal Statistical Society (RSS), AAAS, and MICCAI. He has served as a program committee member for various conferences, and a regular reviewer for many prestigious journals in his fields and received best reviewer awards (most recently MICCAI 2016 Best Scientific Reviewer Award). Prof. Bagci is the recipient of many awards including NIH's FARE award (twice), RSNA Merit Certificates (5+ times), best paper awards, poster prizes, and several highlights in journal covers, media, and news. Prof. Bagci was co-chair of Image Processing Track of SPIE Medical Imaging Conference, 2017, and technical committee member of MICCAI 2018.
