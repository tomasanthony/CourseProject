Please give me at least two weeks notice and details on where, when, and how I need to dispatch the letter. In addition, I'll need a short statement highlighting your interests and career goals, so that I can write an effective letter. Research Interests Evolutionary dynamics on complex networks, machine learning Education PhD, Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston , 2013 MS, Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Boston , 2001 BS, Electronics and Telecommunication, VESIT , Mumbai, India, 1996 Biography I was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai and grew up in Mumbai. I received my primary and secondary education at Model English School and higher secondary education at Ruparel College . During my second year at Ruparel College, I attended the famous (now defunct) Agrawal Classes . I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from Vivekanand Education Societys Institute of Technology (VESIT) in 1996 after which I worked for two years as a software developer at Tata Interactive Systems , where I designed and implemented multimedia-rich e-learning software. I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Boston (UMB) in 2001, following which I worked at BMC Software as a software developer until 2006. My role at BMC Software was to design and develop system- and application-level performance-monitoring software. I then decided to seek a PhD degree in order to fulfill my ambition of pursuing a career in academia with both research and teaching responsibilities. I received my PhD in Comptuer Science, also from UMB, in 2013. My thesis, entitled Evolutionary Dynamics on Complex Networks , was directed by Prof. Timothy Killingback from the Mathematics Department. Page generated 2019-01-21 06:01:42 EST, by jemdoc .
