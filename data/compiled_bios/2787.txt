 Mona Singh Home Publications Software Teaching Group My group's research is in computational molecular biology, as well as its interface with machine learning and algorithms. We are particularly interested in predicting specificity in protein interactions and uncovering how molecular interactions and networks vary across context, organisms and individuals. We leverage high-throughput biological datasets in order to develop data-driven algorithms for predicting protein interactions and specificity; for uncovering protein functions via sequences and structures; and for analyzing biological networks in order to uncover cellular organization, functioning, and pathways. An appreciation of protein structure guides much of our research.
