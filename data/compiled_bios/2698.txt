Slides of WINE'14 Tutorial Teaching COMP211: Computer Networks COMP331/557: Optimisation Short Bio I received a Diplom in Communication Engineering in 2000, from the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen . After working as a developing engineer for 5 months at a startup company, I went to Clemson University , where I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2001. I then went to Paderborn, Germany where I was a member of Burkhard Monien's research group . There I received my Ph.D. (more exactly my Dr. rer. nat) in 2006 with summa cum laude. From September 2007 to August 2009, I was a postoctoral researcher in the group of Richard Karp at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley. In September 2009, I joined the Economics and Computation Group at the University of Liverpool . My research focuses on Algorithmic Game Theory. Conferences & Workshops SAGT 2009 , PC member.
