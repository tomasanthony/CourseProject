Biography Pravin Varaiya is Nortel Networks Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the UC Berkeley. From 1975 to 1992 he was also Professor of Economics at Berkeley. From 1994 to 1997 he was Director of the California PATH program, a multi-university research program dedicated to the solution of California's transportation problems. Varaiya has held a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Miller Research Professorship. He received Honorary Doctorates from L'Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse and L'Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, and the Field Medal and Bode Lecture Prize of the IEEE Control Systems Society. He is a Fellow of IEEE, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is on the editorial board of "Discrete Event Dynamical Systems" and "Transportation Research---C". He has co-authored three books and over 300 technical papers. The second edition of High-Performance Communication Networks (with Jean Walrand and Andrea Goldsmith) was published by Morgan-Kaufmann in 2000. Structure and Interpretation of Signals and Systems (with Edward Lee) was published by Addison-Wesley in 2003. .
