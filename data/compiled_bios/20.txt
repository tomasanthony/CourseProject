Family! I'm a computational geometer/topologist with more general interests in algorithms, data structures, and lower bounds. Sometimes I'm the area chair for the CS department's theory group . I teach mostly large algorithms classes ; you might find my lecture notes useful. From 2013 to 2016, Iwas an associate department head and chair of the faculty recruiting committee. Ihave the lowest undergraduate GPA (2.4/4.0) of any professor I've ever met, although some of my colleagues came close, and some others never finished college at all. (Ireally shouldn't be proud of that.) Ilike pancakes . Praxis tendatum docebit. [Practice will teach those who try.] Carl Friedrich Gau, describing the fast Fourier transform (c. 1805) Man mu jederzeit an Stelle von Punkte, Geraden, Ebenen Tische, Sthle, Bierseidel sagen knnen. [One must always be able to say tables, chairs, beer mugs in place of points, lines, planes.] David Hilbert to Otto Blumenthal, on the axiomatic method in mathematics I believe in the third dimension, but not the other two. James "Kibo" Parry As we all know, the easiest way to be at the top of your field is to choose a very small field. Simone Giertz , "Why you should make useless things" (2018)
