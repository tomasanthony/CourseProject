 Sanjeev Arora Charles C. Fitzmorris Professor of Computer Science Princeton University CV/Bio/Professional Publications Teaching Personal Links, photos Group Website I am a member of the groups in Theoretical Computer Science and Theoretical Machine Learning . In the past I have worked on: Computational Complexity (see my book on this topic ), Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs) , computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems, and related issues. For several years now I am most interested in developing new theory for Machine Learning (including deep learning). See my group website and also the blog offconvex.org that I contribute to. News: In 2017-2020 I am 50/50 at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study where I am leading a new program in Theoretical Machine Learning. (Postdoc applications are welcome at both institutions; apply by Dec 1 2017). Dec 1 2019 Deadline: Special year-long machine learning program at IAS. July 2018: Link to ICML tutorial: "Toward Theoretical Understanding of Deep Learning." August 2018: Slides of plenary lecture at International Congress of Mathematicians 2018: "The mathematics of machine learning and deep learning." More links here.
