Delia Garbacea FULL-TIME FACULTY -  About Me Biography I was born, raised, educated, and worked for a while in Romania. I am working at De Anza College since September 1998. I really love to teach and I hope you can tell that during this class. Remember, there is no such thing as a dumb question: you want to understand before you get lost. In addition, please be assured that I'm ready to assist you in any way possible as you meet the challenges ahead. There are volunteer tutors available in the CIS laboratory. In order to be successful in this class you will have to make a commitment to Studying, Reading the text, Doing your homework, Writing your lab assignments, and Attending class. Come to class on time, prepared, ready to learn and participate! You may find that it is tough for you to understand some things and that you have to work very hard to learn, but you will feel a great sense of accomplishment as your program works and you understand why!
