I have a courtesy appointment with Linguistics and Cognitive Science . Before Arizona, I was a research scientist in the NLP group at Stanford and chief scientist of Lex Machina . I did my PhD in computer science at Southern Methodist University . I work on systems that process and extract meaning from natural language texts such as question answering (answering natural language questions), information extraction (converting free text into structured relations and events). I focus mostly on interpretable models, i.e., approaches where the computer can explain in human understandable terms why it made a decision. For mode details about my work, please visit our research group's page . For more on natural language processing (NLP) work at University of Arizona, please see our NLP cluster page . For Fall 2018 I teach Algorithms for Natural Language Processing (CSC 585).
