Short Bio Liqiang (Eric) Wang is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida . He is the director of Big Data Computing Lab. He was a faculty member (2006-2015) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wyoming . He received Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stony Brook University in 2006. He was a visiting Research Scientist in IBM T.J. Watson Research Center during 2012-2013. His research focuses on integrating deep learning, parallel computing, and program analysis, which includes the following aspects: (1) improving the robustness, accuracy, speed, and scalability of deep learning; (2) optimizing performance, scalability, resilience, and resource management of big data processing, especially on Cloud, GPU, and multicore platforms; (3) using hybrid program analysis to detect and avoid programming errors, execution anomaly, as well as performance defects in large-scale parallel computing systems. He received NSF CAREER Award in 2011 and Castagne Faculty Fellowship (2013-2015).
