 David Fouhey David Fouhey Quick info: CV Google Scholar Email (Reveal): (About joining my research group) If you're the type of person who browses without javascript, your first guess for my email is probably going to be right.<br/> Name FAQ: `foe'-`eee'. It rhymes with snowy or Joey: the key is to forget how it is spelled. It (but not me) is from County Cork, Ireland. Photos: One picture is hard to identify a person with. Here are some more. Summary: I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Michigan. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, working with Alyosha Efros and Jitendra Malik. Before that, I received a Ph.D. in robotics from CMU at where I worked with Abhinav Gupta and Martial Hebert. About Joining My Group I am always looking for motivated and talented students. If you are a UMich student, contact me by email and let's talk! If you are not in a UMich degree program, please apply directly and mention my name (as well as others that interest you) in your research statement. I cannot respond to all inquiries about joining my group, but the short version is that: (1) I am currently looking for students but applications are read by a central committee. (2) I am not currently looking for visitors, summer interns, or capstone projects without a direct recommendation from someone I know. News Research Teaching Publications Misc. Fun & Games News I started at the University of Michigan. I visited Josef Sivic and Ivan Laptev in INRIA, Willow Group, and had a wonderful time. Check out our new video dataset, VLOG Research I work on computer vision and machine learning and I am generally interested in these two areas. However, I am particularly interested in two aspects of vision. Both are motivated by the somewhat obvious observation that images are the projection of a real, physical, and 3D world to a 2D image plane of an agent. This has lead to research on understanding the world in terms of: physical properties: How do we recover a rich 3D world from a 2D image? I am especially interested in representations -- the answers that are obvious are also obviously defective -- as well as how we should reconcile our strong prior knowledge about this structure of the problem with data-driven techniques. functional properties: How do we infer and understand opportunities for interaction? I am interested how an agent (e.g., human or robot) can interact with the world, including in terms of what this implies for 3D understanding. Teaching U.
