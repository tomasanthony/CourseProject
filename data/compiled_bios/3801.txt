 Dingding Wang Florida Atlantic University Assistant Professor Department of Computer & ElectricalEngineering and Computer Science Office: EE 510 Phone: 561-297-3228 Email: wangd AT fau.edu Short Biography Dr. Dingding Wang received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Florida International University in 2010 and B.S. in Computer Science from University of Science and Technology of China in 2003. Piror to joining FAU, she worked as a postdoctoral associate in Center for Computational Science at University of Miami from 2011 to 2014.She was also a research intern in NEC Labs (Cupertino, California) in summer 2007, 2008, and 2009. Research Overview Dr. Wangs primary research interest lies in data mining, information retrieval, and machine learning for improving document understanding. In particular, her research goal is to help users to better understand and utilize large real document data sets via document clustering, summarization, and storyline generation. She also works on research topics related to social network analytics, bioinformatics, music information retrieval, recommendation systems, and malware detection.
