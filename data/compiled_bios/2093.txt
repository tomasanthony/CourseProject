Balajee  Vamanan Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Contact Building & Room: 1310 SEO Office Phone Voice: (312) 413-2424 Email: bvamanan@uic.edu Related Sites: View full profile About I am an Assistant Professor in the department of computer science at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) . My research interests primarily lie in computer networks , specifically in datacenters and low-latency networks, software-defined networking, and network hardware. I have secondary interests in architecture and hardware design. I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University in August 2015. I spent the summer and fall of 2012 at Google on datacenter congestion control and load balancing. I worked as a senior design designer at Nvidia between 2004 and 2008 when I designed the memory controller for the first unibody MacBook Air (see this this newspaper clip!). I got my bachelors degree from BITS, Pilani (India). Aside from research and teaching, I enjoy playing tennis and badminton. I live in Chicago with my wife, Bhairavi Swaminathan , who is a researcher in molecular biology and genetics. I maintain a code repository as well as a LinkedIn page. Topics: Datacenter and low latency networks Software-defined networking Router architecture Networks for bigdata applications Lab: Our research group is part of BITS lab . BITS lab has researchers who are interested various topics related to networking, systems, and security.
