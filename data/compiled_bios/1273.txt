Mikhail Atallah Distinguished Professor of Computer Science Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (courtesy)Joined department: Fall 1982 EducationPhD, The Johns Hopkins University, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1982) MS, The Johns Hopkins University, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1980) BE, American University in Beirut, Electrical Engineering (1975) Professor Atallah's research interests are in information security and algorithms. His work on key management received the 2015 CCS Test of Time Award. He was the 2017 recipient of the Purdue Arden L. Bement Jr. Award, the most prestigious award the university bestows in pure and applied science and engineering. He was the 2016 recipient of the Purdue Sigma Xi Faculty Research Award, and the 2013 recipient of the Purdue Outstanding Commercialization Award. He is Fellow of both the ACM and IEEE, and was a speaker nine times in the Distinguished Lecture Series of top Computer Science Departments. He was keynote and invited speaker at many national and international meetings, and has served on the editorial boards of top journals and on the program committees of top conferences and workshops. He was selected in 1999 as one of the best teachers in the history of Purdue University and included in Purdue's Book of Great Teachers, a permanent wall display of Purdue's best teachers past and present. In 2001 he co-founded Arxan Technologies Inc, to commercialize a software protection technology developed jointly with his doctoral student Hoi Chang (in October 2015, Arxan reported that applications secured by it were running on over 500 million devices). He was CTO of Arxan Technologies and Chief Scientist for its defense subsidiary, Arxan Defense Systems. Arxan Defense Systems was acquired in 2010 by Microsemi Corporation, and Arxan Technologies was acquired in 2013 by private equity firm TA Associates. Selected PublicationsMarina Blanton, Mikhail J.
