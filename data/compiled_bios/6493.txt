 Shachar Lovett's homepage Home Publications Teaching Workshops Talks Links Hi! I am an Associate Professor in the CSE department in UC San Diego. I am part of the Theory of Computation group and help run the theory seminar . I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science and mathematics. In particular computational complexity, randomness and pseudo-randomness, algebraic constructions, coding theory, additive combinatorics and high-dimensional geometry.
