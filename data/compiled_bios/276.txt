 I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. I am also a Research Professor in the Massive Data Institute (MDI). My specialization is what I like to call - data-centric computing. It means that I work on lots of aspects of data driven computer science - data mining, data privacy, data science, and data visualization to name a few. I like working with noisy, messy, partial data to determine what its limitations are, what I can say about it, and what I can learn from it in ethical, privacy-preserving ways. more > research projects: - Privacy and WebFootprinting - Animal Networks (collaboration w/ Shark Bay Dolphin Project) - Election Dynamics (collaboration w/ Gallup & University of Michigan) - Forced Migration (collaboration w/ ISIM) outreach: - GU Women Coders (guWeCode) - ACM Capital Region Celebration of Women in Computing (2017 - at GU) - CS4HS Workshop for High School teachers (2013) - Women in Computing Luncheon(2008) meetings & workshops: - NSF Big Data Research and Hubs and Spokes PI Meeting (2017) - NSF Big Data PI Workshop (BDPI-2016) - NITRD Big Data Strategic Initiative Workshop (BDSI-2015) - NSF Information Integration & Informatics (III-2010) select papers & reports: Publication List (generated from BibBase) NSF Big Data PI Meeting Final Report - 2017 Download Overlapping target event and storyline detection of online newspaper articles.
