Dr. Ye's past and current research activities, which have received over $8M external funding support and have produced seventy-six journal papers and three books (including  Secure Computer and Network Systems: Modeling, Analysis and Design and  The Handbook of Data Mining ), fall into the following two areas.     Data and knowledge exploration , involving the following data and applications.   o  Computer and network data for real-time decision making to detect and assess cyber attacks and security risks on computer and network systems. Through data mining, statistical analysis and data modeling, attack-sensitive data variables are selected, statistical and mathematical features of data are extracted and examined to discover distinctive univariate and multivariate characteristics of cyber attack data, data models are defined to represent discovered data characteristics, and detection and assessment algorithms which incorporate data models are developed.

Through data mining, statistical analysis and data modeling, brain data (including electrical spike waveforms and structural/functional images) are analyzed to discover statistical/mathematical features and characteristics of brain neuron population dynamics, and data models are defined accordingly and employed in applications for BMI and disease prediction/treatment.   One example of sponsored research :     Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, February 2007 - February 2009, N. Ye (Director) , "Cluster of Data Exploration and Modeling for Brain Science."   o  Urban system and environment data for urban system sustainability. Through data mining, statistical analysis and data modeling, urban metabolic flow data (including data about water, materials, energy, waste, air quality, etc.) are analyzed to understand interrelationships of urban systems and to design sustainable urban system infrastructures.     Optimization and quality control of system process and operations, involving the following systems.   o  Computer and network systems for dependability, especially service stability and end-to-end delay guarantee. Though modeling, simulation and optimization of job scheduling, admission control and resource reservation, job waiting time variance is minimized at local and regional levels of computer and network services, and end-to-end delay guarantee is enabled at the global level of computer and network services.

R. China. Dr. Yes past and current research activities have received over $8M external funding support and have produced seventy-eight journal papers and three books.  Yes research focuses on modeling, mining and analyzing massive data to understand dynamics of computer and network systems and biological brain systems which will be used to develop system solutions to improve the design of information systems for Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Information Assurance (QoIA). Her recent research involves understanding statistical/mathematical data characteristics of normal use and attack activities on computers and networks to develop intrusion detection algorithms, understanding cause-effect dynamics of service activities, resource state and QoS performance on computers and networks to enable QoS adaptation and tradeoff between QoS and QoIA, and understanding neural population dynamics of biological brain for motor movements to develop human-brain interface applications for assisting people with disabilities in motor functions.  nongye@asu.edu 480-965-7812 BYENG 482  http://enpub.fulton.asu.edu/ye/  Education  Ph.D., Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, 1991 M.S., Computer Science, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, 1988 B.S., Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China, 1985  Research interests  Information and systems assurance, data mining and modeling, quality optimization and control of system operations  Key activities   Associate Editor, Information, Knowledge, Systems Management  Associate Editor, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, & Cybernetics, Part A  Editorial Boards: International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction ; Information, Knowledge, Systems Management    October 7, 2015  CIDSE              CIDSE in the News Students utilize informed decision-making skills to make a difference Students fresh perspectives lead ASU researcher to success Predicting the future with better data visualization Changing the game: Best Paper models cyberwarfare game theory Meet the Fulton Schools outstanding graduates of Fall 2018  CIDSE on Facebook   ASU School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering  CIDSE Main Office   480-965-3190  Brickyard Engineering (BYENG) 553   699 S Mill Ave, Tempe,AZ  85281    Academic Advising Center  Tempe   480-965-3199  Centerpoint (CTRPT) 105   660 S Mill Ave, Tempe,AZ  85281    Academic Advising Center (Online Degree Programs)  Polytechnic   480-727-3520  Picacho Hall (PICHO) 245   7151 E.
