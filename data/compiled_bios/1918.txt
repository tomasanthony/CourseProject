 Ardalan Amiri Sani Assistant Professor Computer Science Department University of California, Irvine Email: ardalan at uci dot edu Office: Donald Bren Hall #3206 Home Students Publications Courses Services Downloads I joined the CS department at UC Irvine in July 2015. I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the ECE department at Rice University, and my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology. I direct the Trustworthy Systems Lab (TrussLab).
