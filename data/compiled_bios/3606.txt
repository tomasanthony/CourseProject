Her areas of interest include theories and applications of signal, image and video processing and 3D computer vision. She has won a number of best paper awards, including the IEEE Signal Processing Society in 1997 and 2009, IEEE Circuits and Systems Society in 1997 and 1999 and IEEE Solid Circuits Society in 2008. Prof. Zakhor received the B. S. degree from Caltech and the S. M. and Ph. D. degrees from MIT all in electrical engineering, in 1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively. She was a General Motors scholar from 1982 to 1983, was a Hertz fellow from 1984 to 1988, received the Presidential Young Investigators (PYI) award from President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990, and Office of Naval Research (ONR) young investigator award in 1992. In 2001, she was elected as IEEE fellow and in 2018 she was chosen as the Electronics Imaging Scientist of the year by Society of Photographic instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). She co-founded OPC technology in 1996, which was later by Mentor Graphics (Nasdaq: MENT) in 1998, and UrbanScan Inc. in 2005 which was acquired by Google (Nasdaq:GOOGL) in 2007. She founded Indoor Reality in 2015 to develop technologies for rapid 3D mapping and visualization of buildings and assets; .
