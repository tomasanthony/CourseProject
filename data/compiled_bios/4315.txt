Ariane Middel Ariane Middels research interests lie in the interdisciplinary field of urban climate with focus on climate-sensitive urban form, design, landscapes, and infrastructure in the face of extreme heat and climatic uncertainty. For the past six years, Middel has advanced the field of urban climate science through applied and solutions-oriented research employing quantitative and qualitative field observations, local and microscale climate modeling, and geovisualization to investigate sustainability challenges related to heat, thermal comfort, Urban Heat Islands, water use, energy use, and human-climate interactions in cities. Her ongoing research is focused on developing better models and metrics to quantify urbanheatscapesas they are experienced by pedestrians. She currently develops a thermal comfort model based on an innovative big data approach using Street View data, deep learning, and novel environmental sensing techniques such as the biometeorologicalMaRTycart. Middel is an active member of the Urban Climate Research Center (UCRC) and the Central ArizonaPhoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) program at ASU. She currently serves a 4-year term (2016-2020) on the Board of the International Association of Urban Climate (IAUC), the premier international organization for researchers engaged in all aspects of urban climate scholarship. She is also member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), International Society of Biometeorology (ISB), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Middel joined the School of Arts, Media and Engineering (AME) as an Assistant Professor in 2018. She has a joint appointment with the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE). Previously, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University and an Assistant Research Professor with the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at ASU. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science (Visualization) from a German National Science Foundation funded international graduate school at University of Kaiserslautern, Germany and holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Engineering from University of Bonn, Germany. ariane.middel@asu.edu Education Ph.D. Computer Science, University of Kaiserslautern, Germany 2008 BSc. & MSc.
