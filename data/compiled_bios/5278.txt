 Education MS in Computer Science, Wollongong University Australia BS in Engineering, Dalian University of Technology China Biography Ming Huo is a part-time lecturer at Northeastern Universitys Seattle campus, specializing in application security engineering. Mings skill set includes the ability to identify security vulnerabilities by way of security architecture review, code review, and penetration testing, as well as the ability to provide security remediation options and recommend the best practices for given applications. He also has an excellent background in programming skills such as C#, C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, and script languages. Ming worked as an online security software engineer at Sears from 2013-2015, where he was responsible for designing security standards and ensuring SDLC adopted through the development lifecycle. While at Sears, Ming worked on projects related to his field. One such project involved designing security requirements on user authorization, performing security assessments, and providing remediation options for detected vulnerabilities in online platforms for managing home devices such as garage doors and general thermostats. Another project involved performing back-end testing with tools SoapUI and Burp, conducting code review with HP Fortify SCA, and auditing the user profile database for PII and PCI data to deliver identified user authentication issues and to provide necessary remediation options for detected vulnerabilities in online user profile payment services. Ming also assisted with the planning and integration of SDLC in the development lifecycle, worked closely with the development team to explain certain risks, and performed testing with Burp and scanning with AppScann to deliver identified vulnerabilities and remediation options for a project involving a gifting platform that allows users to turn physical items into digital gift cards to send via email. Ming earned his Masters in Computer Science from Wollongong University in Australia, and his Bachelors in Engineering from Dalian University of Technology in China. :
