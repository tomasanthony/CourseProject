Business Experience Ph.D., Computer Science, Iowa State University Fujitsu Computer Products of America, Inc. Intellistor Division, Longmont, Colorado. Consultant for design and implementation of analytical models for platform architectures employing disk arrays. The project involved the mathematical analysis of a platform architectures for the purpose of creating an analytical model based on Markovian interpretation of the architecture when viewed as a queuing network. Stochastic processes were employed for both the transitional as well as the steady state behavior of the system. The primary features of these architectures lies in the use of redundant arrays of the inexpensive disks (RAID). The RAID technology was also modeled in the mathematics. Implementation was in a Unix environment using the C programming language. Other documentation tools include Emacs and Latex. Consultant to SESI, Inc. Broomfield, Colorado.
