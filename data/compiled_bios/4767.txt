Benson Contact arb@cs.cornell.edu 413B Bill & Melinda Gates Hall @austinbenson arbenson Assistant Professor of Computer Science Field Member of Applied Math Cornell University My research develops computational frameworks for analyzing and understanding large-scale and complex datasets from the Web, social networks, biology, and other scientific domains. I usually approach problems with a combination of network science, matrix and tensor computations, and applied machine learning. [ Curriculum Vitae ] My research is supported by the ARO and the NSF. Recent news and events 11.09.2018. My research with Rediet Abebe, Michael Schaub, Ali Jadbabaie, and Jon Kleinberg on Simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction was published in PNAS . See the Cornell Chronicle article Predicting future combos, from rap songs to pharmaceuticals for the highlights. 06.07.2018. I organized a minisymposium on mining and modeling network data at SIAM Discrete Mathematics '18 in Denver. [ web ] 05.04.2018. I gave a minitutorial on tensor eigenvectors and stochastic processes with David Gleich at SIAM ALA '18 in Hong Kong. [ web ] [ slides ] [ code ] Upcoming and recent talks 05.27.2019.
