Contact Office: Rm 209 McAdams Hall Voice: (864)656-7684 Email: rge AT CLEMSON DOT EDU For Prospective Students I usually recruit 1-2 new Ph.D. students to join my lab every year. Self-motivated students are strongly encouraged to contact me. Rong Ge is Associate Professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University. Her research interest includes high performance computing, parallel and distributed systems, and performance and power analysis and modeling. Dr. Ge co-directs the Scalable Computing and Analytics Lab with Dr. Xizhou Feng. The undergoing research explores novel systems and software design to improve performance, scalability, energy efficiency, and resilience of compute- and data-intensive applications on parallel and distributed systems. Particularly, it takes an experimental systems approach that combines system prototyping, profiling, modeling, and controlling, and develops theoretical foundations and enabling technologies to scalable computing and analytics. Dr. Ge is a recipient of the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award in 2015. Before joining Clemson University she was Assistant Professor at Marquette University.
