 Mordecai J.GOLIN (PhD, Princeton, 1990) Professor , COSC Program Coordinator Bio: After receiving his doctorate from Princeton University in 1990, Dr Golin worked as a researcher in the Projet Algorithmes of the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) in Rocquencourt, France before arriving at HKUST in 1993. Since then, he has also been a visiting researcher at the University of Waterloo, the MADALGO Center for Massive Data Algorithms, the Max-Planck-Institut fur Informatik, INRIA-Sophia, AT&T Labs-Research, and DIMACS. In addition he served as the HKUST Associate Vice-President for Postgraduate Studies from 2011-2014. Research interests: The theory, design and application of algorithms; computational geometry; information theory; combinatorics.
