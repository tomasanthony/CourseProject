 Research (Topic) Research (Year) Teaching Talks Google Scholar My research interests fall broadly into three categories: programming languages, software engineering, and systems. More specifically I am interested in language, compiler, and runtime design for achieving reliability. Along with Steve Ko and Karthik Dantu, I have founded the Reliable Mobile Systems group at UB. My work has been supported by the following grants: CRI:CI-New: Collaborative Research: Extensible, Software Enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. $900,000. Role: PI. Credit: 31%. CAREER: Enabling Adaptable, Object Oriented, Real-time Systems. $500,000. Role: PI. Credit: 100%. MRI: Development of iCAVE2 -Instrument for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Evaluation and Experimentation. $1,699,274. Role: co-PI. Credit 14%. III: Small: Just in Time Data Structures. $499,274. Role co-PI. Credit 50%. II-EN: Collaborative Research: Positioning MLton for Next-Generation Programming Languages Research. $605,970 Role PI. Credit 63%. CI-P: Planning for a Community Infrastructure to Enable Pocket-Scale Data Management Research. $100,000 Role co-PI. Credit 33%. II-NEW: Collaborative Research: An Extensible Software Infrastructure for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. $85,000. Role PI. Credit 50%. I am involved in a number of large software projects: PocketData : a database benchmark and dataset for mobile devices (Open Source). RTDroid : a real-time Android variant (Open Source). RTML : a SML compiler for real-time systems built from MLton (Open Source). Multi-MLton : a multi-core aware extension of the MLton SML compiler (Open Source). The Fiji VM : a real-time Java VM with support for mixed-criticality applications (academic licenses available). Sting : an optimizing compiler extension to SessionJ that utilizes JavaFlow (Open Source). BlueSeal : a Soot extension for security analysis of Android apps (Open Source). Recent News: Congratulations to Feng Shen and Yin Yan for officially receiving their Ph.D.s. I have received the UB award for Teaching Innovation for 2017. Implementation for our real-time SML compiler (built on MLton) is available, it is an early stage prototype. Implementation for RTDroid is available, including data sets, and scripts. Latest publication accepted to RTAS 2017. Implementation for BlueSeal string analysis for Android is available, including data sets and scripts.
