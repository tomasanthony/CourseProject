Luther A. Tychonievich Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. Brigham Young University, 2005M.S. Brigham Young University, 2008Ph.D. University of Virginia, 2013 "Computers obey whoever tells them what to do them, unerringly and tirelessly. I teach people how to tell computers what to do." Luther A. Tychonievich, Lecturer Prior to accepting a position as a full-time lecturer in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia, I graduated from the University of Virginia, Brigham Young University, and Lakeland Community College. I wrote my first program and declared my CS major between my second and third year of college; I fell in love with its versatility, scope, and power; it is a field that combines the human-defined purity and elegance of mathematics with the real-world impact of engineering. During my graduate work I became fascinated with the issues relating to education of a new generation of computer scientists and how to help people from backgrounds that are traditionally-underrepresented in CS recognize the marvelous opportunities the field offers and excel in the field. In addition to teaching, I devote significant effort to the education of educators (primarily teaching assistants, but also high-school and college faculty) and to the design of data models that encourage correct mental models in humanities research as part of FHISO and rootsdev.
