Congratulations to my student Yingjie (Tom) Fei! In Spring 2019 I am teaching ENGRD 2700 Basic Engineering Probability and Statistics (course webpage) . Please contact Cindy Jay (cjh6@cornell.edu) forenrollement issues. Bio I am an assistant professor in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University (also a graduate field member of Computer Science , Electrical & Computer Engineering , Statistics , and Applied Mathemathcs ). My research interests include machine learning, high-dimensional and robust statistics, and optimization. Some of the topics that I am interested in are: sparse recovery and compressed sensing, robust matrix completion andPCA, graph clustering and community detection in networks, mixture problems,large-scale learning and optimization, computational and statstistical tradeoffs, and non-convex statistical algorithms. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2013 from The University of Texas at Austin , advised by Constantine Caramanis . From 2013 to 2015 I was a postdoc in the EECS department at the University of California, Berkeley hosted by Martin J. Wainwright . In 2014 and 2015 I was a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore . I received my B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University . I worked as an intern at Raytheon BBN, IBM and Siemens.
