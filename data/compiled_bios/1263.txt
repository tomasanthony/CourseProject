 University of California at Santa Cruz Faculty avg @ cs.ucsc.edu Office: E2-355 (831)459-4611 ALLEN VAN GELDER Professor of Computer Science Education: B.S., Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ph.D., Computer Science, Stanford University Allen Van Gelder's research interests include development of algorithms for propositional satisfiability and quantified boolean formulas, methods for verifiable software, theorem proving, analysis of algorithms, parallel algorithms, computer graphics, and scientific visualization. He received a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1989 to investigate the use of logic programming for problems in database and artificial intelligence systems.

ProofChecker documentation and code WildBenches2009 has 20 benchmarks from the Application section of the SAT 2009 competition, phase 2. The reason these are called wild is that their behavior seems to be rather unpredicatable. It might be that solver A solves instance 1 in a minute or so while solver B times out at 5 hours, and at the same time, solver B solves instance 2 in a minute or so while solver A times out at 5 hours. In some cases, slightly jiggling an instance or a parameter of the solver changes the time by a large factor. I am talking about good solvers that did well in this competition and/or earlier competitions. The selection is heuristic, not scientific. My intention is to have a set of benchmarks that a researcher can conceivably solve completely without ANY timeouts. Some instances are SAT, some are UNSAT.

We do not have privileges for that directory, so we should use meta tags on school computer systems to avoid search engines. See https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_meta_tag I think one puts the following in index.html in the "head" section to ask robots not to search the directory in which index.html resides. So do not put it in your primary web directory (PUBLIC_HTML usually). <meta name="robots" content="noindex" /> If you tell certain people the name of the directory, they will be able to visit it by typing it after the name of your public web directory. As an experiment I made a "secret" directory named DoUSeeMeDir with one file in it besides index.html, named doUSeeMeFile.txt. You should be able to visit DoUSeeMeDir and view doUSeeMeFile.txt, but I hope the search engines do not show either. c-adt.ps c-adt.pdf For information about Computer Algorithms, Third Edition by Sara Baase and myself, please click here to see Supplements (including errata, clarifications, sample code, javaToC hints) or shift-click to download Supplements.tar (about 320 KB) or visit these links to other servers, and use the Back button on your browser if you want to return to this page.
