 Anagha Kulkarni Assistant Professor Computer Science Department San Francisco State University Ph: 415 338 2539 Office: Thornton Hall 970 ak@sfsu.edu Publications Research Group Courses About I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at San Francisco State University . The research areas of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning form the foundation for the work that is conducted in my lab. My students and I are currently investigating problems in (a) core IR where the focus is on balancing search precision and recall efficiently, (b) open-domain and live question answering, and (c) biomedical text analytics and retrieval. I am also involved in an interesting pilot program PINC (Promoting INclusivity in Computing) where the goals are (a) to improve diversity in computing, (b) to improve computing literacy in non-CS fields. I serve as the Sophomore advisor for the Computer Science department, and have chaired the graduate admissions committee in the past.

In the past I have taught Introduction to Computer Programming , and Discrete Mathematical Structures for Computer Science . In Fall 2017 I started instructing a new course ( CSc 698: Topics in Computing ) for the PINC program. In this 2-semester long course students work in groups on a project of their choice. Here are some of the project topics that the students have undertaken in Fall `17: social media data analysis to detect messaging biases related to stigmatized medical conditions, image processing for biological cells, classification of sequencing data for HIV subtypes, an educational game for teaching genetics, alcohol level detection using facial image processing, audio analysis, and geo locations.
