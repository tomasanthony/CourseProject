 T. S. Eugene Ng Professor of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering Rice University 3005 Duncan Hall, 6100 Main St., MS 132, Houston TX 77005-1892 Office: (713) 348-4389 Fax: (713) 348-5930 T. S. Eugene Ng is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering at Rice University. He was selected as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow and received an IBM Faculty Award in 2009. He also received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2005, and is a Kavli Fellow. He holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering with distinction and magna cum laude from University of Washington, a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a holder of four U.S. patents. His current research interest lies in developing new network models, network architectures, and holistic networked systems that enable a robust and manageable global networked infrastructure for the future. Eugene grew up in Hong Kong and can never resist good "dim sum" or good soup. When he is not working, you are most likely to find him speeding down the road on his race bike. Research The fantastic people who did these wonderful things (May 2018 1 ; May 2014 1 2 3 ; May 2013 1 2 3 ; April 2011 1 ) BOLD ( B ig data and O ptical L ightpaths D riven) Lab - Investigating creative use of high-performance, low-power optical networking devices to invent a transformative computing infrastructure for solving big data problems. Network Control and Management - Aims to develop the blueprint designs that will guide decision-makers in the construction of a next generation network that is dependable and secure; understandable to users and operators; and both economical and scalable. Maestro - An operating platform that oversees a network and orchestrates network operations. Maestro version 0.2.1 OpenFlow Controller released under LGPL v2.1. Click this link for source code, tutorial, documentation, technical papers, etc. Cloud/Data center - Pacer: virtual machine migration progress management , wide-area virtual machine storage migration , hybrid packet and circuit switched network architecture for accelerating data center traffic, data center network performance analysis, big-data processing application modeling. Network Data Plane Bug Detection - Develops network monitoring solutions to detect data-plane-disrupting bugs. Tesseract - A 4D network control plane. Meta-Management System - BIOS for a network. Internet Geometry - Aims to develop geometric models of the Internet's crucial structural properties, much like distances between locations on the Earth can be represented compactly by their geometric longitudes and latitudes. Geometric models are inherently simple and scalable, and thus can enable a wide variety of scalable performance-aware protocols and applications. Delay Space Synthesizer DS 2 - An Internet delay space synthesizer that can be used to synthesize Internet delay data at a large scale compactly while preserving important properties of the real Internet delay space. Global Network Positioning (GNP) - Techniques to accurately model the complex Internet distance topology as a simple Euclidean metric space. Network Positioning System (NPS) - An Internet-scale service that enables hosts to determine where they are in the Internet and how they relate to each other topologically. Network position information will be a powerful tool for "navigating" the complex Internet and will enable new distributed applications. Past projects COMPASS - The COMPASS project is developing a new sensor network architecture whose communications hierarchy is aligned with the information flow of its computations. End System Multicast - The ESM project is building a peer-to-peer overlay multicast system that aims to support large-scale overlay-based television on the Internet efficiently and robustly. 100x100 - Clean slate redesign of Internet architecture. Address Virtualization Enabling Service (AVES) - A network service to unify the naming and routing of heterogeneous IP, NAT-connected IP, and IPv6 hosts. I'm also interested in research related to IPv6 transition. REUNITE multicast routing - A unique multicast protocol in which forwarding is based on traditional unicast forwarding, thus it requires minimal multicast forwarding state in the network. Distributed cooperative caching for streaming multimedia - A system designed to handle static caching of streaming object segments and dynamically caching and sharing on-going streams. Packet fair queueing algorithms - Channel-condition Independent Fair Queueing (CIF-Q) algorithm for error-prone wireless cellular networks, Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (H-FSC) scheduling algorithm for flexible resource management and sharing. Darwin - A system that provides a set of resource management mechanisms to value-added network services. Related projects include VNS , a virtual private network service on CAIRN.
