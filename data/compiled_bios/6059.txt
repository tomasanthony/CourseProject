I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by Prof. Prashant Shenoy in 2016. I am a system builder. My research is about modeling system behaviors, especially these of large scale systems, and to build prototypes that help to empirically evaluate system's behaviors. Broadly, I am interested in designing systems to handle new trade-offs in cost, performance and efficiency. Specially, I have worked on research projects , in the context of distributed systems and cloud computing, that automate cloud resource management tasks, improve distributed application performance and provide new system abstractions. I am always excited to work with motivated and qualified students on cloud-scale system and mobile deep learning research. Please email me with an updated CV if interested!
