I am particularly interested in building such intelligent systems for improving health, medical care, education, and accelerating scientific discovery , and bulding them based on theoretically sound frameworks, models, and algorithms that are also effective empirically. My current interests include Intelligent Information Retrieval , Text Data Mining , Applied Machine Learning , Optimization of Human-Computer Collaboration , Biomedical and Health Informatics , and Intelligent Educational Systems . For a more detailed view of my research interests, you may want to take a look at the slides of some of my recent talks .
