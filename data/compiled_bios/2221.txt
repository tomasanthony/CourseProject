 Michalis Polychronakis About Teaching Publications Resume Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Stony Brook University mikepo[at]cs.[domain] 355 Computer Science Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY 11794-2424 About I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University. My main research interests are in the areas of network and system security and network monitoring and measurement. I received the B.Sc. ('03), M.Sc. ('05), and Ph.D. ('09) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete, Greece, while working as a research assistant in the Distributed Computing Systems Lab at FORTH-ICS. Before joining Stony Brook, I was an associate research scientist at Columbia University.
