 Toggle navigation KTM@CS Teaching Research Education Curriculum Vitae Kevin McDonnell Associate Professor of Practice I am a member of the teaching faculty in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University , where I have worked since the summer of 2015. I teach a variety of 100-level and 200-level Computer Science courses for CS majors and non-majors, ranging from courses on computer programming (Python, Java) to discrete mathematics (logic, sets, formal proofs) to systems fundamentals (assembly programming, basic architecture). I also serve as a faculty adviser for the undergraduate computer science major at Stony Brook and am the primary contact for candidates for the CS major as well as freshmen CS majors. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Stony Brook University and also my B.S. in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics ( summa cum laude ). During my graduate studies I was awarded both a University Graduate Council Fellowship and a GAANN Fellowship (Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need). My research interests include information visualization, visual analytics, geometric modeling and user interfaces. I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Golden Key National Honor Society.
