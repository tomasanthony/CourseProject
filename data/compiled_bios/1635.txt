CV Education 2005 Ph.D. in Computer Science, UC Riverside 2002 M.S in Computer Science, UC Riverside 1999 B.S in Computer Science, UC Riverside Research Research interests: My research has focused on the mining of large datasets. Whilemost of my work has focused on mining time series data, I have also considered and am interested in mining images, texts and other types of multimedia data. I have published work on time series similarity search, clustering, motif discovery, symbolic representation, visualization, anomaly detection, and grammar induction. Publications Resources (NEW!)
