 Kevin M Crosby Director, Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium; Professor of Physics and Astronomy, and Computer Science Straz Center 76 kcrosby@carthage.edu 262-551-5855 : Professor Kevin M. Crosby teaches in the Physics and Astronomy Department and Computer Science Department at Carthage, and has chaired both departments. Dr. Crosby served as Division Chair for the Division of Natural Sciences for 10 years and as Dean of the Division of Natural and Social Sciences for one year. Crosby currently directs the NASA Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium. He has taught broadly across the physics curriculum, including courses in planetary astronomy and global climate science. He is currently involved in a variety of undergraduate space science research initiatives, includingsuborbital payload experiments, parabolic flight experiments, and CubeSat projects. For the 2018-19 Academic Year, Crosby is on leave, serving as Senior Scientist at NASA Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center where he works on the Modal Propellant Gauging Project . Prof. Crosby came to Carthage in 1998 from the University of Northern Colorado, where he was visiting assistant professor of physics. Crosby CV . Ph.D. Physics, Colorado State University M.S.

Professor Crosbys research interests include: Carthage Microgravity Program Physics students at Carthage, led by Professor Crosby, have the opportunity to conduct significant research for NASA and have flown aboard NASAs microgravity aircraft, the Weightless Wonder. Students also participate CubeSat opportunities, in near space balloon research, and in suborbital rocket payload development through NASAs RockSat program. Computational Physics At Carthage, students have applied molecular dynamics (MD) code to study a variety of problems in materials science. We use a cluster of 12 computers shared with the Computer Science Department to run both classical andquantum ab initio MD code. . Over $6M in external grants and contracts.
