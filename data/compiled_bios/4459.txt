We developed effective and scalable techniques that extract mobile app behaviors from different perspectives by analyzing multiple types of artifacts, including app code, app descriptions, API documents, app meta-data, and graphical user interfaces (GUI). Wedeveloped security data analytics techniques that automatically identify the causes and impacts of attacks andquery systems thatenable attack investigation usingsystem audit data. Wedeveloped static program analysis techniques and dynamic symbolic execution techniques to improve software testing ( ICSE'2011 , ASE'13 , ICSE'16 Edu , DSN'18 ), bug detection ( ISSTA'13 , ISSTA'14 ). Wealso developed text analysis techniques to improveaccess control policy extraction ( FSE'12 , ACSAC'14 ) andprecondition extraction fromAPI documents ( ICSE'12 ).
