Research Interests Broadly, my research area is the applications of logic and formal methods in computer science. My research is motivated by the close connection between mathematical proofs and computer programs, an idea that is made precise by the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Areas of specialty include functional programming, constructive logic, type theory, theorem proving, applications of proofs-as-programs, extraction of programs from formal proofs. I am also doing joint research with colleagues in the philosophy department designing logics to model beliefs. Selected Publications James Caldwell and Ryan Roan.
