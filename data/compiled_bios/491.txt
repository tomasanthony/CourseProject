Associate Clinical Professor, Masters Program in Computer Science CONTACT INFORMATIONEmail: brady@cs.uchicago.edu Courses include: Algorithms Advanced Algorithms Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Foundations for Computational Data Analysis Linear Algebra BIOGRAPHY  Studied mathematics and physics as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, graduating with a degree in mathematics with honors in the College.\xc2\xa0 In the Honors Program at the University of Chicago in both mathematics and physics. Began study of probability theory, statistics, numerical linear algebra, and numerical analysis as a result of interest in physics.\xc2\xa0 Number theory was a mathematical interest.\xc2\xa0 Pursued graduate study at the University of Chicago and received a doctorate in logic from the University of Oslo, Norway, in 1997.\xc2\xa0 Expanded version of doctoral thesis published as a book in 2000 by Elsevier, in Studies in History and Philosophy of Mathematics series.\xc2\xa0 Was a member of a pioneering team that computerized editing, production, and publication of the Astrophysical Journal and the Astronomical Journal for the American Astronomical Society at the University of Chicago Press in the 1990s. How well do you feel MPCS has kept up with the demands graduates face in the workplace?\xc2\xa0 "The courses I teach in the MPCS all emphasize problem solving and help students improve their problem-solving skills.\xc2\xa0 Problem solving is important in the workplace, and in recent years many of our graduates have been hired at leading firms, in part on the strength of the problem-solving skills acquired in their MPCS courses." What do you see as the most important advantage of receiving a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree from the University of Chicago MPCS? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Graduates of the MPCS are perceived to be intelligent, creative, and able to learn new subjects quickly.\xc2\xa0 The University of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s superb academic reputation carries over to the MPCS."
