 Todd Torgersen Welcome to my web page, and allow me to introduce myself. I joined the faculty in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Wake Forest University in the Fall of 1989. Since then, the joint department has split into two departments: the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Computer Science. Most of the material has been moved from this page.
