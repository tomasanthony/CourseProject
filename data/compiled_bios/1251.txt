 Toggle navigation Faisal Nawab Home Publications C.V. GSDM My research lies at the intersection of Big Data management and distributed Cloud Computing systems. Specifically, I work on data management systems that accelerate and support data science and global connectivity especially in the context of autonomous, mobile applications and the Internet of Things . Research Statement: Data processing is the driver of the sustained growth and impact of Internet services and Big Data analytics. The global nature of users and data invites a Global-Scale Data Management paradigm. In my work, I study and build global-scale systems with a focus on providing high performance and easy-to-use database abstractions. Looking forward, two trends in computing will increase the demand on Global-Scale Data Management drastically and will ignite a transformation of data management systems. The first trend is the emergence of Device-driven systems for autonomous applications, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile agents (self-driving cars and robotics). The second trend is the emergence of Data-driven applications such as data science and machine learning. My ongoing work explores the opportunities and challenges in supporting the increasing demand of device-driven systems by augmenting data management systems with edge computing technology to increase and diversify resources. Also, I explore domain-specific system designs to support the complexity of emerging data-driven applications.

Additionally, it provides higher levels of fault-tolerance. My work in this area investigate the challenges in building global-scale data management systems.

I studied the implications of emerging flush-on-fail CPU technology on the durability cost of transactions. Also, as an intern in MSR Redmond I worked on the Time-Split Bw-tree (TSBw-tree) that integrates the algorithms of the Time-split B-tree within the lock-free implementation of the Bwtree.

A MAC-layer solution is developed to transparently improve TCP fairness. The proposed MAC layer, called TMAC, uses a timestamp-ordering technique to achieve fairness.
