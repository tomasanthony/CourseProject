Sahraoui, Houari	My research interests include, among others, automated software engineering. I am particularly interested in model transformations learning from examples using evolutionary approaches. I also work on reverse engineering (comprehension) and reengineering (refactoring, migration to component-based software, etc.) of software using static and dynamic analysis. My concerns also include visualization of large sets of multidimensional data for software comprehension and maintenance.
