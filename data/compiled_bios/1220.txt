 Snigdha Chaturvedi Search this site Navigation Home Professional Contact Home I am an Assistant Professor at UCSC. Before this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Dan Roth 's group at the University of Pennsylvania and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign . I finished my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park working with Dr. Hal Daume III . Before joining UMD, I was a Blue Scholar in the Information Management team at IBM-India Research Labs, New Delhi from Aug. 2009 to Aug. 2011. My undergraduate years were spent in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur from where I graduated in 2009 as a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. My bachelor's thesis focused on the problem of predicting cardiological conditions from automatic analysis of ECG signals. Note for prospective graduate students: Even though I would love to, it is not possible for me to respond to all emails from prospective students. If you are interested in working with me, please apply to UCSC's PhD program in CS and mention my name in your statement-of-purpose. Depending on the pool of applicants and my funding situation, I intend to admit either 0 or 1 student every year.Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide an estimate of an individual's likelihood of getting into the program without looking at all applicants. Please do not ask me to do that. Also, I don't have summer internship positions in my lab. If you have a question that was not answered here and you are sending me an email, include "CMPS" in your subject so that it doesn't go to my spam folder and I know that you have read this :) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- News : -- April 2018: Joining as an Assistant professor at UCSC -- April 8, 2016: Defended my dissertation -- December 10, 2015: Magazine article on our work here -- November 12, 2015: 3 papers (on desire fulfillment and relationship modeling) accepted for presentation at AAAI 2016 -- August 21, 2015: Selected for attending the WPI STEM Faculty Launch Program -- April 22, 2015: Awarded the Kulkarni Summer Research Fellowship by UMD for this summer. -- March 12, 2015: My IBM PhD Fellowship was renewed.
