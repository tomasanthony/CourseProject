Cheriton School of Computer	Science	University of Waterloo	Email: trefler at cs.uwaterloo.ca	Telephone: +1 519 885 1211 ext. 37508	Teaching	CS 360 Winter 2018 --- under construction.	CS 360 Winter 2018	Research	My research focuses on the application of automated reasoning tools, such as model checkers,	to the analysis of reactive systems, including: computer hardware and software systems; embedded	systems; and routing and communication protocols. Of particular interest are compositional reasoning and abstraction techniques	for coping with the state explosion problem in model checking.	Additionally, I am interested in: visual notations for describing systems and their	specifications; automata on infinite objects; temporal, modal, and description logics;	Internet-based routing and communication protocols; and analysis of parameterized systems.
