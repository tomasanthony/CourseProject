After receiving his B.Sc. in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Toronto, he worked in signal processing and underwater acoustics at the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Nova Scotia, Canada. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Rutgers University, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. He was a post-doctoral fellow at INRIA-Rocquencourt, in France, and an assistant professor of computer science at Indiana University, Bloomington. Since 1991, he has been a faculty member at the University of Toronto, where he is now an associate professor of computer science and a member of the Collaborative Graduate Program in Genome Biology and Bioinformatics (CGPGBB) . In 1999, he was a visiting professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvannia. Contact Information: Anthony J.
