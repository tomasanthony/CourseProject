Categories Uncategorized Deep Brain Stimulation research from BRL is on the news! July 4, 2017 by Niveditha Kalavakonda Prof. Howard Chizeck and students of the BioRobotics Lab have developed a method to deliver targeted treatment to people suffering from Essential Tremors using brain signals. They combined electrodes on top of the brain to sense movement in the parts of the body that experience essential tremor, along with a deep brain electrode, to deliver stimulation only when its needed.

June 23, 2017 June 23, 2017 by Niveditha Kalavakonda Over the weekend, Ph.D. students Katherine Pratt and Timothy Brown attended Awesome Con, Washington DCs Comic Con. They were panelists for a session titled THE HUMAN-TECHNOLOGY FRONTIER: TO ENHANCEMENT AND BEYOND? at Future Con, a science and technology celebration inside Awesome Con to discuss the intersection of science, engineering and science fiction. They were joined by Dr. Dan Cosley and moderator Dr. Suveen Mathaudhu for a discussion about the cutting-edge research in engineering, computer science, materials, biology, and the social and ethical implications of our increasingly technologically advanced lives. A huge shoutout to the National Science Foundation for making this event possible! Check out some of the pictures from Future Con, courtesy of Kevin Pratt. Panelists (L to R): Dr. Suveen Mathaudhu, Tim Brown, Katherine Pratt, Dr. Dan Cosley Star Talk Live (L to R): Scott Adsit, Katherine Pratt (Woohoo!) and Colonel Chris Hadfield Katherine and Tim sharing their wealth of knowledge with Future Con attendees!
