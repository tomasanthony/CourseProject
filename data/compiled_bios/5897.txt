["Professor of Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering and Materials ScienceEducation1997, Doctoral Degree, Applied Physics, Harvard University1993, Master's Degree, Applied Physics, Harvard University1992, Bachelor's Degree, Physics and Electrical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis BiographyProfessor Lu received dual B.S. degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering in 1992 at Washington University in St. Louis. After studying in Professor Michael Tinkham's research group at Harvard University on superconducting single-electron transistors, she received her Ph.D in 1997. She subsequently conducted her postdoctoral research on the electron transport of individual carbon nanotubes at UC Berkeley under the University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship. Research SummaryThe research of Professor Lu focuses on the investigation of metals and semiconductors whose size is reduced to the nanoscale (less than 1/1000 of the width of a human hair). Her research activities include the fabrication of nanostructures using both lithography and self-assembly techniques; characterization of their electrical, optical, magnetic, and topological properties; and development of nanoscale systems with enhanced functionality. In particular, she is interested in the quantum states and dynamics of electron charge and electron spin which will be essential for future applications in high density, low power and ultra fast electronics. This includes but not limited to memory and logic circuits, chemical/biological sensors, optoelectronic devices, spintronic devices, and energy harnessing devices.Awards2015 Helmholtz Foundation Faculty Research Award2010 DAAD German Academic Exchange Research Fellowship2005  Maseeh Best Faculty Research Award in 2005.2004 White House Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 20042002 National Science Foundation Career  National Science Foundation Career Award in 2002AppointmentsPhysics and AstronomyMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Electrophysics OfficeSSC 215BFrank R.
