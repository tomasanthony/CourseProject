Y. Charlie Hu Professor of Electrical and Computer EngineeringProfessor of Computer Science (courtesy)Joined department: 2003 EducationM.S., Yale University, Computer Science (1992) MPhil, Yale University, Computer Science (1992) PhD, Harvard University, Computer Science (1997) Y. Charlie Hu's research interests are in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, Internet and Wireless Networking, and High Performance Computing. He has done extensive work on smartphone energy profiling and debugging, data center networking and cloud computing, program-counter-based techniques for the I/O management in operating systems, Internet routing, routing security, network measurement, peer-to-peer overlay networking, the synergy between peer-to-peer and grid computing, and the synergy between peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc networking. He has published over 150 papers in these areas, including publications in ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, IEEE Transactions on Computers, ACM/IEEE Transactions on Networking, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, IEEE JSAC, USENIX OSDI, USENIX HotOS, NSDI, EuroSys, HPCA, ACM SIGCOMM, Hotnets, ACM Sigmetrics, ACM/USENIX IMC, ACM CoNEXT, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE/ACM SC Conferences. Prof. Hu received the National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2003, and the Honda Initiation Grant Award in 2002. He served as a TPC Vice Chair for SBAC/PAD 2009, ICDCS 2007 and ICPP 2004 and a co-founder and TPC co-chair for the International Workshop on Mobile Peer-to-Peer Computing. Prof. Hu is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and an IEEE senior member. He is a Purdue University Faculty Scholar 2011-2016. Selected PublicationsAbhinav Pathak, Y.
