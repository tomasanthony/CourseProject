 Toggle navigation Amir Rahmati Home Teaching Research Prospective Students Publications Useful Links Contact Amir Rahmati Assistant Professor Stony Brook University Biography Amir Rahmati /mi:r rhmti/ (written as in Persian) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University . He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan working with Professor Atul Prakash . He received his Masters degree working with Professor Kevin Fu at SPQR Lab and his B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology working with Professor Seyed-Ghassem Miremadi . His research focuses on the security of emerging technologies and resource-limited systems such as embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. His works involve designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. Research Overview Im generally interested in the area of security and privacy. My research focuses on securing emerging technologies. Think about the most recent gadgets or technology that you have heard about, or the cutting-edge research that are happening in other fields. Are there new and unique security and privacy challenges associated with them? How much thought has gone into securing them? My research focuses on identifying and exploring these challenges and developing insights, models, and systems that enable us to secure technologies that will become main-stream in the future. Teaching CSE508: Network Security Stony Brook University - Fall 2018 EECS 588: Computer & Network Security University of Michigan - Winter 2017 Ethos Lab I lead the Ethos lab at Stony Brook University. In Ethos lab, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Cyber-Physical systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data & activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design. Prospective Students Im looking for students with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work on challenging research problems across the system stack. Do you like designing and developing elegant systems that tackle real-world problems? Do you have expertise in hardware, software, machine learning, UX, or network protocols and measurement? Are you passionate about security and privacy? If your answer to these questions is yes, there may be a place for you in my group. Interested? Fill out this form and tell me about yourself. Then, apply to our graduate program .
