Over the past few years, I have had the good fortune to collaborate with several different research centers specializing in both analytical and measurement based approaches. My focus areas include content distribution including P2P methods, network economics, learning and game theory, wireless ad-hoc networks, and the measurement and analysis of Internet data.
