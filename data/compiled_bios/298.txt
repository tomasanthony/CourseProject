[1] [2] About me My primary research interests are in computer graphics, especially in animation and perception of virtual characters. Character animation techniques and algorithms . I am particularly interested in developing new animation techniques using motion capture, statistical properties and learning through databases. Perception of lifelike virtual humans . Humans are capable of successfully distinguishing between human and computer-generated motions, even if the differences are marginal. This skill makes it a challenge to produce convincing animations, especially for very realistic human-like virtual characters. I aim to determine which components of human motion are crucial to lifelike appearance and which errors diminish this realism. Hand and finger motions . Hand and finger motions are omnipresent in daily life. Nevertheless, virtual characters often lack convincing hand and finger motions. Capturing, analyzing, understanding, and automatically generating these subtle movements are topics I address in my research. I am also interested in virtual reality, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I received my PhD in 2011 from the Graphics, Vision and Visualization Group at Trinity College Dublin , Ireland , advised by Carol O'Sullivan . I then spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon's Graphics Lab working with Alla Safonova and Jessica Hodgins . During my PhD, I also conducted research as a visiting student in the Graphics Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and as an intern at Disney Research, Pittsburgh .
