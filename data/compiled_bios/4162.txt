Osbert Bastani is broadly interested in machine learning and programming languages research. Recently, he has been working on developing algorithms for ensuring correctness of machine learning models. These models are increasingly used in real world systems where failures can be catastrophic, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and legal decision making.
