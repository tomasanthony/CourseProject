I am looking for passionate students who are interested in systems research. Brief Bio I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2016 under the supervision of Professor Karsten Schwan . Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2007. During my Ph.D. studies, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to intern at different research labs and learn from many remarkable people. I spent the summer of 2015 at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center working with Shu Tao, Hui Kang and Michael V. Le. I spent the summer of 2013 at Intel Science & Technology Center for Cloud Computing, Carnegie Mellon University working with Michael Kozuch. I spent the summer of 2012 at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center working with Dilma Da Silva and Kyung Ryu. I spent the fall of 2011 at Microsoft Research Asia working with Zhenyu Guo. I spent the summer of 2010 at VMware working with Ajay Gulati. Research Interests (Groups Homepage) I conduct systems research, specifically addressing high performance and enterprise applications on virtualized and distributed platforms; focusing on big data analytics systems, specific research interests include runtime adaptation [ C7 ], methods for online resource management [ C4 , C5 ], and system support solving enterprise motivated real-world problems that embody complicated data analytics [ C6 , C8 , C9 , C10 , C3 , J3 ]; focusing on systems virtualization, research interests range from basic technologies [ C2 , J1 ] to innovative technology application [ C1 , J2 , C11 ]. My research focused on three topics: big data systems, datacenters and cloud computing, system virtualization and distributed systems. Some of my current projects include: Big Data Systems : Oases , GOVERNOR , ELF , FastMR , Project Hoover Datacenters and Cloud Computing : RBay , v-Bundle Systems Virtualization and Distributed Systems : Docman , Net-Cohort , Look Whos Talking Other projects on: Performance Troubleshooting in Datacenters , Live Migration of VMs , Magnet , LVD All Citable Works 1.
