We developed Intelligent Conversational Assistants based on deep, formal models of natural language understanding and collaboration. We applied these to problems ranging from logistics to health care to command and control. Expertise : Artificial intelligence; Intelligent agents: agent communication languages, agent architectures; User interfaces: speech recognition, natural language understanding, dialogue, conversational agents; User-centered design; Temporal reasoning: representation, planning, scheduling; Semantic web: ontologies, knowledge-based systems; Medical informatics: electronic medical records, personal health records, self-care technologies.
