 Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick tberg@ucsd.edu I've moved to UCSD! Please find my new website here . I'm an Assistant Professor of Language Technologies in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University . My research group works on natural language processing and machine learning, focusing on unsupervised methods for deciphering hidden structure. We develop techniques for analyzing various kinds of human data, including natural language -- but also diverse sources like early modern books, handwritten text, historical ciphers, and music.
