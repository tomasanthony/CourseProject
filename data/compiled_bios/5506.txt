Aaron B. Wagner Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 388 607/255-1017 wagner@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Aaron Wagnerjoined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2006 and was elevated to professor in July 2018. During the 2005-2006 academic year, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Visiting Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell. Wagner did his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Wagner's research and teaching have been recognized with several awards including theIEEE Information Theory Society's James L. Massey Research & Teaching Award for Young Scholars(2017), the Douglas Whitney '61 Excellence in Teaching Award from Cornell Engineering (2015), the Cornell Michael Tien '72 College of Engineering Teaching Award (2009), the NSF CAREER award (2007), the David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize from the U.C. Berkeley EECS Dept. (2006), and the Bernard Friedman Memorial Prize in Applied Mathematics from the U.C. Berkeley Dept. of Mathematics (2005). Two of his students won the 2010 Information Theory Society Student Paper Award.. Research Interests Wagner studies problems at the intersection of information theory and other fields including networking, statistics, queueing theory, security, computational linguistics, and learning.His primary research interest lies in information theory, especially compression, feedback communication, security, and quantum information.
