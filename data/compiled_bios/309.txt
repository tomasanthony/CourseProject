In Fall 2012, I joined the School of Computing at Clemson University. I am also a Faculty Scholar of the Clemson University School of Health Research . Before that I was at Argonne National Laboratory . My undegraduate school is Ben-Gurion University of the Negev . I am actively looking for highly motivated students to work with (both undergraduate and graduate). You are always welcome to stop by my office to chat. Click here to see if I have an immediate M.Sc/Ph.D. opening. Undergraduate students click here .
