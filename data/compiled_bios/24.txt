 Margaret M. Fleck I'm a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign . Office: 3214 SC Phone: 265-6838 (rings so rarely I have trouble recognizing what the noise is) mfleck@illinois.edu (much better ideal) Research Interests My research interests include computational linguistics, computer vision, and programming language tools to support language and vision research. Right now, I'm working on unsupervised algorithms that learn word boundaries from transcribed speech. CV Check out my publications and the Schwa 1.0 release ! Some old research projects: programming support for computer vision (envision) , skin detector , fast order statistic filter Teaching Discrete math textbook: Building Blocks , now with self-study problems.

Schedule (Spring 2019) In the following table, colored items happen every week. Uncolored items happen only some weeks but not others. Because of my kids, I'm on an early schedule: typically at Siebel by 8:30, often out of the office late afternoon. Try email or piazza when you can't find me in person. Orange times towards the end of the day mostly involve transporting children, so I may be able to free these times (e.g. get my husband to take them) with advance notice. WARNING: not all meetings are set up yet. In particular, I'll have a couple office hours (beyond the implied one at the end of lecture), but I still have to figure out which times they'll be.
