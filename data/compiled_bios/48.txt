He works on high-order numerical methods for the simulation of wave problems as well as issues in high-performance scientific computing that relate to bringing these methods to life on large-scale parallel computers. In support of his research, Dr. Klckner has released numerous scientific software packages. He obtained his PhD degree at the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University with Jan Hesthaven , working on large-scale finite element simulations of wave problems in the time domain. From Brown, Klckner moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University as a Courant Instructor, where he worked on integral equation methods and fast algorithms within Leslie Greengard 's group.
