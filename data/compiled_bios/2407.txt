 Les Miller Les Miller ( lmiller at iastate dot edu ) Professor of Computer Science Iowa State University Ames, Iowa 50011 B.A. 1967, Mathematics, University of South Dakota M.A. 1974, Mathematics, University of South Dakota Ph.D. 1980, Computer Science, Southern Methodist University Honors: IARIA Fellow Member of the European Academy of Sciences Member of the Board of Directors of the International Society for Computers and their Applications Major Interests: Adaptive user interfaces, Usability, Human Computer Interaction, Data Mining, Knowledge Management, Computational Biology, Geospatial Data, and Database Integration. Current Research: Leslie Miller's research activities concern the development of usable interfaces for location dependent applications, the use of error analysis and data mining of user actions to create adaptive user interfaces, techniques for integrating spatial data for use in location dependent applications, infrastructures for managing geospatial data and the development of topic map structures that provide a distributed mechanism for storing and accessing an organization's knowledge. A special research interest is focused on bringing more of what is known in psychology about the individual differences of users into the development of adaptive software interfaces for government agency applications. Agencies, like the US Census Bureau, are especially interesting as they employee large groups of part-time employees for brief periods of time (a matter of weeks). The variety of the employee's skills in such a setting is very large and providing usable software is an interesting challenge. Representative Publications: Rusch, M. L., S. M. Nusser, L. L.
