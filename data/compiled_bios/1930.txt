 charless c. fowlkes professor computer science uc irvine fowlkes@ics.uci.edu 4076 dbh 949.824.6945 uci : cs : vision group home publications presentations software cv My research is in computational vision, in particular how to integrate mechanisms for visual recognition and perceptual organization with 3D scene understanding . We apply these computational models to a variety of problems including development of tools for biological image and shape analysis in neuroscience, animal development and palynology as well as applications to forensic science . recent research highlights: A.
