High Performance Computing and Computational Science 1/8/18 Focuses on efficient experimental and theoretical solutions to problems on state-of-the-art computational systems consisting of large numbers of computational elements, including clouds, clusters, grids, networks-of-workstations, massively parallel supercomputers, and GPU-based systems. Efficient solutions are developed to solve fundamental operations, as well as large scientific problems that require expertise in computer science, mathematics, and scientific or engineering disciplines. Distributed Systems and Networks 1/5/18 Research in networking and distributed systems focuses on enabling communication of and orchestrating coordination of a large number of computing nodes. It spans the areas of cloud computing, big data computing, and wireless and mobile computing. Mobile Systems 1/5/18 Mobile systems research focuses on the design and implementation of next-generation systems for mobile devices. Research topics include mobile data management, wireless networks, sensing systems, static analysis and instrumentation for mobile apps, mobile image and video analytics, and secure and low-power hardware for mobile devices. Medical Applications and Bioinformatics 1/5/18 Focuses on developing highly efficient algorithms and techniques for a wide range of problems (such as automatic analysis of biomedical images, computer assisted diagnosis, treatment planning, protein-protein interaction network analysis, protein structure prediction, computational analysis and interpretation of Genomes, evolutionary studies of Genomic ORFans, and spatial positioning patterns of the cell nucleus) arising in smart hospital, smart healthcare, precision medicine, genomics, proteomics, and microarray analysis. Techniques used in this area are often from algorithms, computational geometry, computer vision, machine learning, data analytics, internet of things (IoT), and high performance computing.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 1/5/18 Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers now predict that computers will be able to perform tasks that were once considered the prerogative of human beings. They include tasks such as driving trucks, translating languages, writing high school essays, creating art, analyzing forensic evidence, and even work as a surgeon. Although some of these goals are predicted to happen over several decades, AI is concerned with principles and algorithms that allow researchers to make such bold predictions. Current methods focus on variants of deep learning-- such as convolutional nets, recurrent nets, autoencoders and adversarial networks-- as well as on the methods of probabilistic graphical models. Databases and Information Retrieval 1/4/18 Focuses on developing fundamental techniques, prototype systems and applications in databases and information retrieval. Computing Education 1/4/18 Focuses on expanding approaches to teaching computing at all levels (K-12 and University) and the outreach to promote computing majors and careers. Addressing retention, diversity, and persistence in computing through educational approaches are targeted. Overall, the objective is developing a skilled and diverse workforce in computing for the future. Programming Languages and Software Systems 1/5/18 Programmming Language research focuses on type systems, program logics, language-based and differential privacy and security; language, compiler, and run-time design for reliable systems; static and dynamic analyses for real-time Android; run-time visualization and verification; adaptive memory management; language concepts for database programming; logic- and constraint-based systems. Cyber-Physical Systems (Internet of Things) 1/5/18 Focuses on the interplay between multiple elements of cyber technologies (such as sensing, computing, communications and control), and physical systems or processes (including infrastructures such as transportation and power) as well as human factors.
