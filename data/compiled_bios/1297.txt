Aniket Kate Assistant Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 2015 Aniket Kate is an applied cryptographer and a privacy researcher. His research builds on and expands applied cryptography, distributed computing, and data-driven analysis toward developing and analyzing robust systems for privacy and (distributed) trust. His current research projects focuses on communication freedom and distributed ledger (or blockchain) protocols. In particular, his group designs and analyzes efficient, provably secure cryptographic solutions for anonymous communication, and formalizes and realizes privacy and censorship-resistance for the emerging communication modalities; they enhance security, privacy, and reliability of distributed ledgers and communication across dissimilar ledgers, and devise their novel crypto-economic applications to the financial world, supply chains and beyond.
