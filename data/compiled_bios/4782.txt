 Christina Delimitrou Assistant Professor, Cornell University Welcome to my webpage! I am an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell where I lead the SAIL group ; I am also a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL), and the John and Norma Balen Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow. My main interests are in computer architecture and computer systems. Specifically, I work on improving the resource efficiency of large-scale datacenters through QoS-aware scheduling and resource management techniques. I am also interested in designing efficient server architectures, distributed performance debugging, and cloud security. Before joining Cornell, I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University , where I worked with Christos Kozyrakis . I had previously earned an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford (2011) and a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (2009). You can find more information in my CV . I am looking for motivated PhD, MS, and undergrad students to join my group! If you are a Cornell student excited about cloud computing, datacenters, and computer architecture and systems in general send me an email with your CV and we can set up a meeting.
