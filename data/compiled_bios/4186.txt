Max's research program focuses on developing a better understanding of the nature of good algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty, with applications to machine perception and robotics. Current research topics include the application of game theory and statistical decision theory for designing robust fixed-geometry confidence regions for multivariate location parameters, and algorithms for robust multisensor fusion and set-valued state estimation with performance guarantees. Max also works with applications of confidence sets for cooperative and noncooperative mobile robots.
