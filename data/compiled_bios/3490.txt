Prospective students should apply directly to our graduate program. Now on to the important stuff :-) My twins girls are the joy of my life. In my free time I try to get in as much scuba diving as I can, which sadly only happens during the summer. Im also into very long power walks . My wife and I are from St. Lucia, and most of our family lives there (yeah, I know, what are we doing here?). If you are looking for a great get-away spot, drop me an email and I'll be happy to give you suggestions on what to do once you get to St. Lucia . I admit that mathematical science is a good thing. But excessive devotion to it is a bad thing --- Aldous Huxley Welcome Contact Info 3175 Sitterson Hall UNC-Chapel Hill NC 27599-3175 Phone: 919-590-6063 Email: click here PGP public key Curriculum vitae
