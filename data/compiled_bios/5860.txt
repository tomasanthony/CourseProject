["Professor of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Computer Science, and Physics and AstronomyEducationDoctoral Degree, Physics, California Institute of TechnologyMaster's Degree, Physics, California Institute of TechnologyBachelor's Degree, Physics, Harvard University BiographyTodd Brun received his Ph.D. in Physics from Caltech in 1994. Since then, he has worked at the University of London, the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  He joined the faculty of USC in 2003.Research SummaryBrun works in the areas of quantum computation and quantum information theory.  He is especially interested in quantum open systems, decoherence, and the effects of environmental noise on quantum information processing and quantum error correction.  He has done recent work on fault-tolerant quantum computation, entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes, quantum walks, continuous measurements and quantum control, orbital angular momentum of photons, weak measurements, quantum mechanics with closed timelike curves, and the arrow of time.Awards2008 IEEE Senior Member2005  NSF CAREER award2001 IAS Chooljian Member for Natural SciencesAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - SystemsComputer SciencePhysics and Astronomy OfficeEEB 502Hughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2565 Contact Information(213) 740-3503tbrun@usc.eduWebsitesPersonal WebsitePublications"]
