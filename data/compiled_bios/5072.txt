My group hasbeen developing advanced algorithms for discrete stochastic simulation of systems where the fate of a few key molecules can make a big difference to important outcomes. We engage with experimentalists through the analysis of data and the development of mathematical models that yield insightand offernew directions for research. Current collaborations range from biology (circadian rhythm [jet lag]and cell polarization), to medicine (coagulopathy and post-traumatic stress disorder), to ecology (chytrid disease in frogs), to social networks(sentiment analysis and opinion dynamics), to materials.We are collaborating with Prof. Chandra Krintz on the development of an integrated, cloud-based environment called Stochastic Simulation Service (StochSS) for modeling and simulation of biological processes.
