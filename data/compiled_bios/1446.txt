Opening for research interns for students from outside of NUS and undergraduate student researchers (USR) for NUS students : Subject to the final approval of funding, I am recruiting research interns/USRs for 2019. The interns/USRs are expected to work on issues related to distributed computing and algorithms in networking. To qualify, the applicant needs to be a top undergraduate student in a top university, with a strong academic track record. I particularly welcome internship applicants with achievements in Mathematics/Physics/Information Olympiad at the national or international level. Please email me to apply. Opening for Ph.D. students seeking advisors : I am actively recruiting Ph.D. students to collaborate on world-class research on distributed algorithms and network algorithms. Besides CS major students, I am also very interested in working with students with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Students with Bachelor's degrees in other related areas (such as Physics) and with strong mathematical background are also very welcome.
