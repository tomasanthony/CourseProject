I study the theory of distributed systems. I am particularly interested in understanding what can and cannot be solved in novel or exotic systems. Among other topics, I have studied the theory behind dynamic networks (in which the participants are unknown, communication can fail, and/or the network topology can change), peer-to-peer networks made up of smartphones communicating with direct radio links, vehicular ad hoc networks, and distributed coordination strategies from nature. Recent funding sources for my work include NSF CCF award number 1733842, "AiTF: Collaborative Research: Algorithms for Smartphone Peer-to-Peer Networks," NSF CCF award number 1320279, "AF: Small: Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Dynamic Links," NSF CCF award number 1649484, "EAGER: Noisy Computation of Distributed State Machines," the Ford Motor Company University Research Program, and the Georgetown Security and Software Engineering Research Center. Before coming to Georgetown I was at MIT, where I received my PhD working with Nancy Lynch in the Theory of Distributed Systems group, and spent two years as a postdoctoral associate working with Hari Balakrishnan in the Networks and Mobile Systems group. In spring 2019, I am teaching the required graduate theory course. The course web site can be accessed here: COSC 545: Theory of Computation.
