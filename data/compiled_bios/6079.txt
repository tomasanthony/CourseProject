 Jacob Whitehill Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Worcester, MA Office: Fuller 238 Email: jrwhitehill(at)wpi(dot)edu Phone: 508-831-6370 Research Interests My research is in machine learning and computer vision, including deep learning, and its applications to affective computing, automatic facial expression recognition, human behavior analysis, and educational data mining. I am also interested in how to make machine learning processes more efficient by devising innovative paradigms for collecting training datasets and annotations. My work is highly interdisciplinary and frequently intersects cognitive science, psychology, and education. Publications 2019 Ramakrishnan, A., Ottmar, E., LoCasale-Crouch, J., and Whitehill, J.
