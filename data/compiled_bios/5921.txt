Prior to joining USC, she was an assistant professor at Cornell Universitys School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2014. She received the B.A.Sc. degree with honors in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto in 2004 and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2006 and 2011, respectively. She held postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard Medical School from 2011-2012 and at the University of California, Berkeley from 2012-2013. She has received various awards including the NSF CAREER Award, the MIT Technology Review Worlds Top 35 Innovators Under 35 (TR35), the Popular Science Brilliant 10, a joint US-UK multidisciplinary university research initiative (MURI) award,the  BARI award for US-UK collaboration on human-machine teaming, the ONR Young Investigator Award, the NAE frontiers invitation, and both the NAE and NAS frontiers invitation as speaker and session chair.Research SummaryDr. Shanechi works at the interface of machine learning, statistical inference and signal processing, and control to develop algorithmic solutions for basic and clinical neuroscience problems. Some applications of interest include developing closed-loop brain-machine interfaces (BMI) for motor function, for control of anesthesia, and for deep brain stimulation to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Her work combines methodology development with in vivo implementation and testing.Awards2019  ONR Young Investigator Award2018  National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Kavli Frontiers of Science Symposium  Invited Session Chair and Speaker2018  IEEE Senior Member2018  DoD BARI award for US-UK collaboration on human-machine teaming2017  National Academy of Engineering (NAE), US Frontiers of Engineering Symposium  Invited Committee Member, Session Co-Chair2016  ARO Joint US-UK MURI Award2015  IEEE EMBC student paper award (faculty advisor to the student)2015  Viterbi Early Career Chair2015  Cal-BRAIN Inaugural Award2015  National Academy of Engineering (NAE) FOE invitation2015  NSF CAREER Award2015  Popular Science Brilliant 102014  Best paper award in Technology, Computation, and Simulation, International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS)2014  MIT Technology Review Top 35 Innovators Under 35 (TR35)2006  Hewlett-Packard Graduate Fellowship 20062006  National Canadian Doctoral Fellowship 2006-2009 (NSERC)2004  Next Generation of Canadian Leaders Selected by the University of Toronto Magazine2004  Wilson Medal in Engineering Science--Ranked first among all Engineering Science graduates at the University of Toronto2004  Gold Medalist, Professional Engineers of Ontario--Ranked first among all graduates in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Toronto2003  National Canadian Undergraduate Research Fellowship (NSERC)2002  National Canadian Undergraduate Research Fellowship (NSERC)AppointmentsResearch Productivity or Research Stipend , MURI grant administrationMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Systems OfficeEEB 408Hughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2564 Contact Information(213) 740-1377shanechi@usc.eduWebsitesResearch WebsitePersonal Website"]
