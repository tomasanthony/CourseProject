Lee et al., ''Temperature-compensated fiber-optic 3D shape sensor based on femtosecond laser direct-written Bragg grating waveguides'', Opt. Express , 21 (20), 24076-24086 (2013). Prev Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Welcome to Prof. Peter R. Herman's Group Our research group studies and develops novel laser processing technology for defining photonic devices, optical circuits, microfluidic and other nanostructures. The laser enables fabrication in novel two- and three-dimensional architectures to be explored in optical materials for broad impact in today's optical communication networks and lab-on-a-chip microsystems.
