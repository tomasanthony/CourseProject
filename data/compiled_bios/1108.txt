Compared to DTI, it has the advantage of providing measures of tissue microstructure that are much more direct and hence more specific. It achieves this by adopting the model-based strategy which relates the signals from diffusion MRI to geometric models of tissue microstructure. In contrast to typical model-based techniques, NODDI is much more clinically feasible and can be acquired on standard MR scanners with an imaging time comparable to DTI. You can learn more by having a look at the ISMRM 2012 presentation or refer to our NeuroImage paper . The matlab routine for fitting NODDI data is also provided.
