I was a postdoctoral fellow in Department of Radiation Oncology at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UTSW) from August 2014 to August 2015. I received Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) in Summer 2014. I received B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology (Software Engineering) and M.S. degree in Computer Science in The University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2006 and 2009, respectively. Research Interests: My research interests include Computer Graphics, Geometric Modeling (specifically Surface and Volume Mesh Generations), Medical Image Processing (specifically Deformable Image Registration, 3D/4D Image Reconstruction) , Computer Animation, Visualization, and GPU Algorithms. Prospective Students: I am looking for self-motivated Master thesis and Ph.D. students to join my research group. RA/TA positions with full scholarships are available. If you are interested in working with me, please send me your CV and related projects/publications.
