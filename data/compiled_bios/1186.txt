Davis Note: This site is not visible to the public - only to site admins. Background I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the College of William and Mary. I received a B.S. from the College of William and Mary, where I double-majored in Computer Science and Mathematics. After completing my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, I worked for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a computer engineer. I then returned to academic study at North Carolina State University, and was awarded a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Afteward, I began working in the School of Computing at Clemson University as an Assistant Professor, and later as an Associate Professor. Academic Interests At Clemson, my primary research focus was computer graphics, with special emphases in parallel rendering and virtual reality. Under two separate NSF grants, we introduced non-trivial graphics problems into the undergraduate curriculum to teach basic concepts in computer science. I was also heavily involved in the Digital Production Arts master's program at Clemson, which teaches students techniques in computer animation for work in the movie and gaming industries. At William and Mary, my primary focus is education across the undergraduate curriculum. Edit this webpage | Main Menu | Logout
