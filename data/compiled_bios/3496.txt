M.S. in Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin, 2007. B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics, Hendrix College, 2003. My research develops better abstractions for managing concurrency and security, primarily in the operating system, and extends these abstractions to other portions of the technology stack as appropriate. I am the ringleader of the Operating systems, Security, Concurrency, and Architecture Research (OSCAR) Lab. I was honored to receive an NSF CAREER award in 2012. During Fall 2017, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Distributed Systems Group at Instituto Superior Tcnico . I am also a Research Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stony Brook University . I am currently serving as a Technical Advisor to Fortanix, working on building secure applications for Intel SGX.
