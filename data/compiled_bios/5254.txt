 Research Interests Algorithms Combinatorial optimization Education PhD in Computer Science, Princeton University BA in Computer Science and Mathematics, Cornell University Biography Neal has been a professor of Computer Science at University of California Riverside since 2004. Before that he worked at Akamai Technologies (1999-2004), was an assistant professor at Dartmouth College (1995-1999), and did postdocs at AT&T Bell Labs (Mathematical Foundations of Computing), Cornell ORIE, and University of Maryland (UMIACS). Hometown West Lafayette, Indiana What is your research focus? My research focuses on approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization, including Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms for large-scale linear programming, online algorithms for caching and data management, and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. :
