 Tapan S. Parikh tapan AT represent DOT org Research Teaching Publications Curriculum Vitae My research group studies how information and communication technologies can empower communities to address shared challenges and determine their collective futures. To do this, we develop, deploy and evaluate the impact of new community information platforms for agriculture, education, finance, health, governance and other areas, both locally, and around the world. I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Information Science at Cornell Tech . I enjoy working with people in industry, government, non-profits and the community. I share some of my periodic thoughts and musings here .
