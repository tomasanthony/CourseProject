Keywords computational vision high-dynamic-range imaging high-dynamic-range displays image-based measuring modeling rendering photo-realistic rendering perceptually-realistic rendering sensing for graphics Interests My primary research domains are computer graphics, and more recently also some aspects of computer vision, especially image-based modeling and acqusition. More specifically, I have recently worked on image-based HDR imaging and displays, geometry acquisition, hardware-accelerated and image-based rendering, and global illumination.
