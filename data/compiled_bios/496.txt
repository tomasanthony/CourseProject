Adam Shaw @ The University of Chicago document.write(banner()); Surfers of the web: welcome! As of December 2012, I am a Senior Lecturer in the  Department of Computer Science at the  University of Chicago. Computer science minors, please scroll down the page a bit. There are many Adam Shaws on the web; I\'m the real one.  More specifically, I am the one born at the (now shuttered) Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio in 1972 (when David Gilmour, and countless others, looked essentially  like this) and who grew up in North Branford, Connecticut. I started programming BASIC on an Apple ][+ my parents bought around 1980, when I was 8years old or thereabouts. I wrote programs on that machine to do things like print my name 10times, then 50times, then 1000times. I thought to myself: hm, this thing has possibilities. Here I am receiving my doctoral degree in August 2011. Computer science minors and would-be minors, I hereby address you in my capacity as the CS minor adviser. Each CS minor needs to fill out a CS minor plan; as long as it passes muster, I sign it, then you take it to your college adviser. Each minor plan consists of a three-quarter intro sequence and any four CMSC 200s. The form to be filled out is available online here:        https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/Consent_Minor_Program.pdf Once I have signed the form, any subsequent changes to the plan can be approved by email. If you haven\'t met with me yet, please contact me directly to set up an in-person appointment. Minor appointments always fit comfortably in a half hour. Are you not sure you want a CS minor? No problem: speculators, inquisitors, gadabouts and peripatetics are welcome.    I love music. A lot. This is some of the music I\'ve been listening to lately.        Beethoven\'s Piano Sonatas. These kind of ate my summer. If     you have some interest in the details of each sonata, I highly and     unreservedly     recommend Andras     Schiff\'s lecture series.    And these are some of the games I\'ve been playing lately: Spirit Island Cool anti-colonial co-op where your team gets more powerful as the game proceeds and, if all goes well, you smash the conquering gamebots to bits. Scythe Area control, resources, some combat. This game is perhaps overhyped, but it is, after all, a good one. The artwork is genuinely outstanding and sets it apart.   Pandemic   Legacy: Season 2 Excellent co-op game with an unfolding story. I   like this even better than Season 1. (We finished, and we won   December. Final score 771 IIRC.) Dominion, which I play with my brother. Last time we played, because we tied, the rules told us to "rejoice in our shared victory." And so we did.
