NetsBlox, our open source, web-based visual programming environment for K12 supports synergistic learning of STEM and Computational Thinking. I co-authored a highly popular introductory programming MOOC available on Coursera. In the WSN domain, my team has developed a novel WSN-based countersniper system . An enhanced version is soldier wearable and not only does it localize the shooter very accurately, but it can also tell the caliber and the weapon type. An interesting paper describes the system in detail. The latest version is smartphone-based. Our radio interferometric positioning approach has gained much attention and resulted in the Best Paper Award at the ACM Sensys 2007 conference. My other focus is Model Integrated Computing. Our latest open source software tool, the Web-based Generic Modeling Environment is a web- and cloud-based, collaborative, configurable toolkit for creating domain-specific visual modeling and program synthesis environments. News New article about our anti-poaching system fundded by Vodafone (September 2018) NetsBlox now does robots and cybersecurity education (July 2018) Addisu Taddese has successfully defended his PhD dissertation on capsule endoscopes (July 2018). Brian Broll has successfully defended his PhD dissertation related to NetsBlox (March 2018). NSF is funding Brian Broll's brainchild: DeepForge (October 2017). Nice article about the MATLAB MOOC (July 2017) WIPER , our anti-poaching project has won 2nd place in the Vodafone Wireless Innovation project (June, 2017) NetsBlox in the news ! (May, 2017) Check out the MathWorks Newsletter on our MOOC! (December, 2016) A new session of the MOOC Introduction to Programming with MATLAB is now available on the new Coursera platform.The MOOC iscurrently ranked #3 in the Top 50 free online courses of All Time in the World on Class Central! (August, 2016). The third session of our MOOC on programming with MATLAB has ended. The three sessions this year saw over 150,000 students enroll. We had about 2 million lecture views and 100,000 homework sets graded! 5,300 students graduated with a passing grade. (December, 2015) Our time synchronization paper from 2004 received the Test of Time Award at ACM SenSys. (November 2014). Our poster on Medical Capsule Robots received the Best Poster Award at ACM SenSys. (November 2014) Our smartphone-based shooter localization systems was featured in news outlets across the globe, including CBSNews.com , the Times of India , Mashable , Futurity , Gizmag (Australia), and Wired's U.K. edition .
