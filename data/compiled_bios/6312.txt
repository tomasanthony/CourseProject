Voinigescu Professor Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Toronto My research goal is to explore novel electronic devices, THz and photonics systems on chip (SoCs), to demonstrate their commercial viability, hopefully leading to new applications for nano-electronics, new products, new companies and wealth creation. The main applications are in telecommunications, radiometry, radio astronomy, high-resolution imaging, industrial, remote, and environmental sensing. Current research themes are Atomic-scale electronic devices and ICs for silicon quantum computing Teraherz sampling techniques for analog and mixed-signal processing mm-wave radios, sensors, radars, and imagers Energy-efficient Tb/s photonic transceivers Please s end your comments to sorinv@ece.utoronto.ca Prospective graduate students must first apply and be accepted for graduate studies.
