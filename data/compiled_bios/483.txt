I also spent two years as a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study   and Princeton University.   Here\xe2\x80\x99s a CV   if you want to know more.                          I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science, particularly in Complexity   Theory. My research is funded by NSF Career Award 1254044
