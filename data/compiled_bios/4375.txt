Brief Bio | Research Interests | Teaching | Publications | Students and Postdocs | Current NSF Grants | Professional Activities Brief Bio: I am an Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department of the Stevens Institute of Technology. I first joined the faculty at Stevens as Assistant Professor in 2002. I received my Diplom in Computer Science from the University in Karlsruhe (Germany) and my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Saarland University (Germany) in 1998. Subsequently, I worked at DaimlerChrysler Research (Stuttgart, Germany), Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill, USA) and RSA Laboratories (Stockholm, Sweden). Research Interests: My research interests are in cryptography and algorithmic number theory. In the field of cryptography, my research is focused on wireless security, secret sharing, privacy, and biometrics, and my contributions range from analysis to protocol design. In algorithmic number theory, my research is centered on lattice theory, in particular on developing new algorithms and heuristics for lattice basis reduction.
