Research Group Welcome to Adwait's Homepage Adwait Jog, Ph.D. (Penn State) Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science College of William & Mary McGlothlin-Street Hall 111 Williamsburg, VA 23187 ajog@wm.edu , Google Scholar Profile Twitter handle: @adwaitjog About I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at College of William & Mary (W&M) in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I am leading the Insight Computer Architecture Lab . Our goal is to generate insights, which would help in architecting future computers that are more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. I am always looking for self-motivated and talented students to join my lab. We have several funded RA positions. Send me a brief email to start the conversation. All graduate admissions are formally managed by W&M CS department . Recent News I will be co-chairing (with Onur Kayiran) the 12th Workshop on General Purpose Processing Using GPU (GPGPU 2019) to be held in conjunction with ASPLOS 2019 . I gave talks in India at Intel Labs, Microsoft Research, and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) related to our recent MICRO and HPCA 2018 papers. Slides are available here . I am invited to serve on the Sigmetrics 2019 , ICCD 2019 , and HPDC 2019 program committees, and HPCA 2019 external program committee. Submit your best work! I gave an invited talk titled Breaking the Memory Wall in Current and Emerging Accelerators at the University of Pittsburgh. Mohamed Ibrahim will be presenting our poster at the ACM SRC competition to be held at MICRO18 . Hongyuan Liu will be presenting our recent MICRO18 paper on efficiently executing large-scale automata. Mohamed Ibrahim and Haonan Wang are back in the lab from summer internships at AMD Research and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), respectively. Gurunath Kadam will be completing a co-op at Intel Labs this Fall. Two papers accepted at MICRO18 . These two papers cover two different topics: a) architectural support for efficient large-scale automata processing, and b) practical GPU reliability analysis. Congratulations to my students and collaborators. I am serving as a publicity chair for CGO19 . The conference website and call for papers is up! ACACES 2018 course website is up with the lecture material. This short GPU course is a part of the computer architecture summer school organized annually by HiPEAC. Research Funding My research group is currently supported by the following research grants: NSF CAREER Award 2018 . News in the Media. Thanks NSF! NSF SHF Award 2017 . Thanks NSF!
