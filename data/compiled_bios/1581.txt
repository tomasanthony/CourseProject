Thanks to NIH for our grant on matching methods for causal inference (big data and networks)! It is a collaborative project with Profs. Allison Aiello (UNC Chapel Hill, Global Public Health), Cynthia Rudin (Duke Computer Science), and Alexander Volfovsky (Duke Statistical Science). Thanks to NSF for my second NSF grant on causal analysis for big data! It is a collaborative project with Profs. Lise Getoor (UCSC) and Dan Suciu (UW). Thanks to NSF for funding my FIREFly project with an NSF CAREER Award ! Background I joined the Department of Computer Science at Duke University in Fall 2015. I am a member of the Duke Database Group (a.k.a. Duke Database Devils; more about Duke Blue Devils ), which is part of the Duke Systems and Architecture Group . Before joining Duke, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering , University of Washington where I worked with Prof. Dan Suciu and the database group . I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science where I was advised by Prof. Susan Davidson and Prof. Sanjeev Khanna . During my Ph.D., I did two internships at IBM Research, Almaden , and received a Google PhD fellowship in Structured Data in 2011. Go to top >> Research I am broadly interested in data and information management with a focus on foundational aspects of databases and big data analysis. My current research focuses on building tools and techniques to help users leverage the maximum benefit from the available data. While my ongoing work on causality and explanations in databases directly aims to assist users get deep insights into data by providing causal analysis and rich explanations to their questions, my work in the areas of data and workflow provenance, probabilistic databases, and crowd-sourcing probes into compelling, fundamental questions that need to be answered to enable end-to-end processing and analysis of unstructured, noisy, and unreliable data in today's world while preserving its entire context.
