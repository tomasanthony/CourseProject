 Sharath Raghvendra Department of Computer Science Virginia Tech Email: sharathr at vt.edu About Me I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I spent two years as a postdoc in the Computer Science and Management Science and Engineering departments at Stanford working with Prof. Leo Guibas and Prof. Ashish Goel . I completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at Duke University where I worked with Prof. Pankaj Agarwal . I received my B. Tech (Hons) (Computer Science) from IIIT, Hyderabad . Research Interests Im generally interested in design of efficient algorithms and data structures for problems in computational geometry and graph theory. My research spans problems from geometric optimization, graph theory, computational topology and online algorithms. Check my publications for more information.
