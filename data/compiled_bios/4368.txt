 Georgios Portokalidis Home Publications Projects Openings Software Teaching Home About Me I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. I obtained my PhD in Compute Science from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on February 2010. I also hold an MSc and BSc in Computer Science from Leiden University and University of Crete, respectively. My research interests are mainly around the area of systems and security. In the past, I have worked on software security, honeypots, taint analysis (information-flow tracking), analysis of binary software, run-time and compile-time software instrumentation, control-flow integrity, code-reuse attacks, Tor, and user authentication.
