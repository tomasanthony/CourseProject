More... Research I'm part of the Systems & Networking and Security research groups. My interests are all over the map, ranging from the economics of e-crime, to automotive and avaiation systems to routing protocols and data center virtualization and back again. I have very broad interests (i.e. try me if you have a crazy idea).

Misc I got my undergrad degree in Applied History from CMU and my Ph.D. from the University of Washington (courtesy Brian Bershad and Tom Anderson). I was Co-founder and Chief Scientist at Asta Networks (now kaput), served on the Strategy Advisory Council of Rendition Networks (since acquired by OpsWare) and helped develop some of the technology used by Netsift (since acquired by Cisco). I do other consulting here and there.
