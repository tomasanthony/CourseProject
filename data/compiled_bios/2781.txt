 Iasonas Petras, Lecturer, CS department@Princeton University ABOUT ME I am a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. Currently, I am the Lead Preceptor for the course COS 340: Reasoning about Computation [ see more ]; I have also been the Lead/Co-Lead Preceptor for COS 217: Introduction to Programming Systems . I was awarded my Ph.D. from the department of Computer Science at Columbia University. My advisor was Professor Joseph F. Traub . My research interests lie in numerical methods and their applications in continuous mathematics, as well as quantum computation. HOME RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS TALKS TEACHING CONTACT In terms of research, I am interested in the algorithmic and complexity analysis of multivariate mathematical problems. The quantum computer is potentially a powerful computational tool. I am looking into quantum algorithms for continuous mathematical and physical problems, that demonstrate a significant speedup compared to their classical counterparts. Information-based complexity refers to the complexity of continuous mathematical problems, such as integration or approximation of continuous functions. The most interesting cases are problems which refer to multivariate functions, where the number of variables (dimension of the problem) is considered "huge". I am interested in studying ways to eliminate the "curse of dimensionality", namely the exponential dependence of the cost of algorithms on the dimension.
