My research focuses on generative designfor gamesand crafts, computational creativity,and issues surrounding feminism andsocial justice especially as they intersect with technology and game design. I am also interested in games for education. Within procedural content generation, I am especially interested in questions of design: how does content generation influence the kinds of userexperiences we can produce? How can content generation be used to augment human design?How has the role of content generation in games changed across time and media? Within computation and craft, I am interested in how technology can be brought to bear on problems faced by a historically technologically underserved creative community, as well as treating generative design as a way to formalize my own creative process. I am interested in generative embroidery and quilting, quilts as a form for data visualization, and novel uses of e-textiles. With regard to feminism and social justice, I am interested in how AI systems, especially generative systems, embed politics and represent diversity throughtheir design. I also have some projects that involve creating technological interventions for social justice issues. Prior to my move to WPI, I was an assistant professor in Art+Design and Computer Science at Northeastern University. I earned my PhD in 2012 from UC Santa Cruz, where I worked in the Center for Games and Playable Media.
