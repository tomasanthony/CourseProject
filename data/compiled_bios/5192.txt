I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Stan Leibler's group group in 1998-1999 (when he was at Princeton University ). I was a graduate student in John Hopfield 's group from 1994-1998 (when he was at Caltech) and in Al Barr's group from 1992-1994 at Caltech . As a graduate student, I also spent time in John Abelson 's lab (at Caltech) and in Ned Seeman's lab (at NYU), and I collaborated with Len Adleman (at USC). Hence: ---(old defunct molecular computation pages)--- and: ---(old SIRDS page)--- . From 1991-1992, I worked with Stephen Wolfram and Matt hew Cook . I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago from 1987-1991, during which time I spent half a year doing math in Budapest . I went to Evanston Township High School and the best math summer camp ever . First science teacher: Dad. His 1964 essay on "The Scientist as Poet" . A nice essay about going to grad school that quotes my dad at the end. Family The love of my life, Lulu Qian . My sister, Rachael Winfree . My brother, Chris Woollcott. My mother, Trish Woollcott. My step-father, Phil Woollcott. My father, Art Winfree . My uncle's experience as artist-in-residence for the National Parks in Alaska. (He and his wife have an art studio .)
