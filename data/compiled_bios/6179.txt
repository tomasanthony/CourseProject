Pramod K. Varshney Distinguished Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 2-212 CST and 3-173 CST 315.443.4013 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph. D. (Illinois) 1976 Lab/Center Affiliation(s): CASE, Director Research Interests: Distributed sensor networks and data fusion Detection and estimation theory Wireless communications Radar signal processing Physical layer security Current Research: There are two broad areas of current research. First deals with fusion of information from a variety of heterogeneous sources. Novel fusion and sensor management algorithms are being developed that enhance system performance as well as conserve system resources such as bandwidth and energy. Typical signal processing tasks are detection, localization, tracking and classification of objects and events. Distributed algorithms based on compressive sensing for these signal processing tasks are also being developed. The second area deals with cognitive networks where network throughput is to be maximized via active sensing and control under a number of system constraints. Security threats such as Byzantines and jamming are being investigated. Mitigation approaches are being developed using game theoretic concepts.
