 I am interested in machine learning, security, privacy, game theory, blockchain and related topics. I havedesigned several robust learning algorithms, a scalable framework for achieving robustness for a range of learning methods, and a privacy preserving data publishing system. I amcurrently working on anomaly detection systems against causative poisoning attacks and malware detection with real world collected big data. I'm also working on adversarial deep learning for training generative adversarial networks (GAN) and designing robust deep neural networks against adversarial examples. Theoretically, Iutilize game theoretic analyses to model the interactions between an intelligent adversary and a machine learner, allowing defender to design robust learning strategies that explicitly account for an adversarys optimal response. Empirically, my currentresearchaims to scalable robust algorithms that can process massive amounts of data available for Internet-scale problems regarding specific cloud computing infrastructure to achieve large-scale secure learning for big data. Previously I have worked onInformation security, Network security, MRI analysis, and other Healthcare related research, andI'm still interested in these topics.
