Tengyu Ma Hi! I am an assistant professor of computer science and statistics at Stanford. My research interests broadly include topics in machine learning and algorithms, such as non-convex optimization, deep learning and its theory, reinforcement learning, representation learning, distributed optimization, convex relaxation (e.g. sum of squares hierarchy), and high-dimensional statistics. I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Princeton University where I was advised by Professor Sanjeev Arora. As an undergrad, I studied at Andrew Chi-Chih Yao's CS pilot class at Tsinghua University.
