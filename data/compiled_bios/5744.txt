Luks Professor Emeritus E-mail: luks AT cs DOT uoregon DOT edu Education BS, 1960, City College of New York PhD, 1966, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Interests Recent research by Professor Luks has involved the design and analysis of algorithms, with a focus on computational solutions to algebraic problems. The main objective is an understanding of the computational complexity and practical solvability of problems involving algebraic structures such as groups. Although there are numerous applications, the work was originally motivated by problems similar to testing graph isomorphism. This resulted in a new group-theoretic approach to the general problem and specifically in polynomial-time procedures for significant graph classes. Current projects tend to be aimed at improved algorithms for a wider class of group-theoretic problems, seeking efficient (especially polynomial-time) solutions to problems for which only asymptotically infeasible (e.g., exponential-time) approaches are currently known. There are also applications to other domains; examples include use of symmetry in constraint-satisfaction problems and application of group-theoretic tools to testing equivalence of switching circuits. For his innovations in graph isomorphism and related issues, Professor Luks was awarded the Delbert Ray Fulkerson Prize in Discrete Mathematics by the Mathematical Programming Society and the American Mathematical Society. In 2012, Professor Luks was elected to the inaugural class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society.
