News! Students Papers Teaching, Service, and Awards Christopher R Email: chrismre at cs.stanford.edu Department of Computer Science Stanford University 353 Serra Mall Stanford, CA 94305-9025 I'm an associate professor affiliated with DAWN, Statistical Machine Learning Group, PPL, and SAIL (bio). I work on the foundations of the next generation of machine-learning-driven systems. These systems extend ideas from databases, machine learning, and theory, and our group is active in all areas. We also build software to support applications and more deeply understand the challenges and opportunities poised by these systems. Our latest project is Snorkel, our code is on github, and there are blog posts about our work. New stuff: In AAAI19, Snorkel folks talk about Training Complex Models with Multi-Task Weak Supervision. We've seen this is a new and exciting way to build machine learning software. Jared's paper is on the cover of Radiology (Dec18) collaboration with great folks in the medical school. In AIStats19, Tri, Avner, and Jian try explain why how low-precision random Fourier features generalize better than Nystrom in the same amount of memory. In ICLR19, checkout great workshops run in part by our students Relational Representaton Learning at NeurIPS, and learning with 2nd Learning with Limited data and Graph Representation Learning at ICLR19. Beliz, Albert, and Fred learn embeddings in mixed product spaces (hyperbolic, spherical, and euclidean). Alex and Braden's thoughts on the role of massive multitask learning and weak supervision in Software 2.0 in CIDR19. Paroma's thoughts about automating weak supervision in Reef in VLDB19 A draft writeup about Bit Centering a technique to use accelerators for low-precision training. ISMP18. A small writeup about Software 2.0 and Snorkel for KDD18. In ICML18, Hyperbolic embddings embed structured knowledge in continuous space, a blog post about our wo Theo, Ihab, and crew have released Holoclean. The DeepDive (one pager) project was commercialized as Lattice. As of 2017, Lattice is part of Apple. Our work on architectural changes for converged analytics and machine learning is commericialized as SambaNova Systems. To validate our ideas, we continue to build systems that we hope change the way people do science and improve society. This work is with great partners in areas including paleobiology (Nature), drug repurposing, genomics, material science, and the fight against human trafficking (60 minutes, Forbes, Scientific American, WSJ, BBC, and Wired). Our work is supporting investigations. In the past, we've worked with a neutrino telescope (IceCube Science cover and our modest contribution) and on economic indicators. A messy, incomplete log of old updates is here. I'm an associate professor affiliated with DAWN, Statistical Machine Learning Group, PPL, and SAIL (bio).

Levent Koc (MS 2011, Google) Balaji Gopalan (MS 2010, Google) We are working on two broad topics: (1) DeepDive is a new type of system to extract value from dark data. Like dark matter, dark data is the great mass of data buried in text, tables, figures, and images, which lacks structure and so is essentially unprocessable by existing data systems. DeepDive's most popular use case is to transform the dark data of web pages, pdfs, and other databases into rich SQL-style databases. In turn, these databases can be used to support both SQL-style and predictive analytics. Recently, some DeepDive-based applications have exceeded the quality of human volunteer annotators in both precision and recall for complex scientific articles. Data produced by DeepDive is used by several law enforcement agencies and NGOs to fight human trafficking. The technical core of DeepDive is an engine that combines extraction, integration, and prediction into a single engine with probabilistic inference as its core operation. A one pager with key design highlights is here. PaleoDeepDive is featured in the July 2015 issue of Nature. DeepDive is our attempt to understand a new type of database system. Our new approach can be summarized as follows: the data, the output of various tools, the input from users including the program the developer writes are observations from which the system statistically infers the answer. This view is a radical departure from traditional data processing systems, which assume that the data is one-hundred percent correct. A key problem in DeepDive is that the system needs to consider many possible interpretations for each data item. In turn, we need to explore a huge number of combinations during probabilistic inference, which is one of the core technical challenges. Our goal is to acquire more sources of data for DeepDive to understand more deeply to change the way that science and industry operate. (2) Fundamentals of Data Processing. Almost all data processing systems have their intellectual roots in first order logic. The most computationally expensive (and most interesting) operation in such systems is the relational join. Recently, I helped discover the first join algorithm with optimal worst-case running time. This result uses a novel connection between logic, combinatorics, and geometry. We are using this connection to develop new attacks on classical problems in listing patterns in graphs and in statistical inference. Two threads have emerged: The first theme is that these new worst-case-optimal algorithms are fundamentally different from the algorithms used in (most of) today's data processing systems. Although our algorithm is optimal in the worst case, commercial relational database engines have been tuned to work well on real data sets by smart people for about four decades. And so a difficult question is how does one translate these insights into real data processing systems? The second theme is that we may need new techniques to get theoretical results strong enough to guide practice. As a result, I've started thinking about "beyond worst-case analysis" and things like conditioning for combinatorial problems to hopefully build theory that can inform practice to a greater extent. The first papers have just been posted. Demos, Examples, and Papers. Worst-case Optimal Joins. We have posted a survey for SIGMOD record about recent advances in join algorithms. Our goal is to give a high-level view of the results for practitioners and applied researchers. We also managed to simplify the arguments. A full version of our join algorithm with worst-case optimal running time is here. The LogicBlox guys have their own commercial worst-case optimal algorithm. Our new system, EmptyHeaded is based on this theory. Beyond Worst-case Joins. This work is our attempt to go beyond worst-case analysis for join algorithms. We (with Dung Nguyen) develop a new algorithm that we call Minesweeper based on these ideas. The main theoretical idea is to formalize the amount of work any algorithm spends certifying (using a set of propositional statements) that the output set is complete (and not, say, a proper subset). We call this set of propositions the certificate. We manage to establish a dichotomy theorem for this stronger notion of complexity: if a query is what Ron Fagin calls beta-acyclic, then Minesweeper runs in time linear in the certificate; if a query is beta-cyclic than on some instance any algorithm takes time that is super linear in the certificate. The results get sharper and more fun. Almost to one algorithm to rule them all? We have a much better description of beyond worst-case optimality with a resolution framework and a host of new results for different indexing strategies. This paper supercedes many of the results in Minesweeper and in a much nicer way!. We also hope to connect more of geometry and resolution... but we'll see! A first part of our attack on conditioning for combinatorial problems is in NIPS and on Arxiv. It is not difficult to get me interested in a theory problem. Ask around the Infolab if you don't believe me. Our goal is to understand the fundamentals of data processing systems. Our course material from CS145 intro databases is here, and we'll continue to update it. We're aware of a handful of courses that are using these materials, drop us a note if you do!
