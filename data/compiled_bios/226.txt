Phone: (716) 645-4755 Fax: (716) 645-3464 Email: bharat at buffalo.edu Dr. Jayaraman received his bachelors and masters degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras , and his doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Utah . Prior to joining the University at Buffalo in 1989, he was on the faculty at the University of North Carolina . He also served as CSE Department Chair at the University at Buffalo during 2001-09. Dr. Jayaraman's research centers around programing languages and software systems. Current topics include: (1) dynamic analysis and visualization in a state-of-the-art execution environment for Java called JIVE ; (2) program analysis and applications of constrained objects, and constraint-based design; (3) formal methods in software and safety-critical systems; and (4) identification, tracking, and retrieval in cyber physical spaces based upon camera networks and biometric sensors.
