A few words about myself... I received a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and then a Master's degree in Digital Signal Processing from Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan) University, Guangzhou, China. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Vision from Kings College, London University, UK. I taught and researched in Sun Yat-Sen University, Shantou University (China), Bath University (UK), National University of Singapore, Institute of Microelectronics (Singapore), and Institute for Infocomm Research (Singapore). In February 2007, I joined the faculty of Nanyang Technological University. I am aFellow of IEEE, a Fellow of IET, a Chartered Engineer, and Honorary Fellow of SIET. My additional duties include serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, and IEEE Trans. Circuits and Systems for Video Technology. My research deals with image processing, perception-based modeling, video compression, and multimedia communication. I believe that good theory is practical and effective teamwork can achieve the goal of "1+1>2"; I have kept a balance of academic research and industrial deployment (and even some business development) in my working life, and also managed over ten successfully-delivered major projects for external customers. It has been my good fortune to have the chances to work with many colleagues and students in various organizations. I always look forward to collaborating with more researchers who think alike, and am eager to meet new students with an interest in image processing, communication and understanding, as well as modeling the relevant physiological and psychological findings. My Final Year Project student, Lim Yuan Jun, developed an interesting demo: Perceptual Characteristics & Phenomena Gallery . We have also built a RetargetedImage Subjective Quality Database and a database for Perceptual Quality Assessment of Screen Content Images (SIQAD). Some related research can be seen here . At leisure, I like reading and taking walks. The books I like include: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen R. Covey; Fishing Lessons-Insights, Fun, and Philosophy from a Passionate Angler, by Paul Quinnett ; A Brief History of Time, by Stephen Hawking; Bounce: Mozart, Federer, Picasso, Beckham, and the Science of Success, by Matthew Syed; The Happy Student: 5 Steps to Academic Fulfillment and Success, by Daniel Wong; LETTERS TO HIS SON , by the EARL OF CHESTERFIELD; Tan Swie Hian Fables; Teacher Man, by Frank McCourt; Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom. I also like Prof Randy Pausch's Last Lecture , and the transcription of "You and Your Research'' by Dr. Richard W. Hamming .
