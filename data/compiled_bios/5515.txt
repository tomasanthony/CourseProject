My research interests are in artificial intelligence, machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, and processing of massive data sets. I am currently working on the application of artificial intelligence techniques to the analysis of uncertain situations and targeted information gathering. I am also working on the application of machine learning and distributed computing to the analysis of massive astronomical data sets and cosmological simulations.
