MarkBunfocuses on theoretical computer science, including data privacy, computational complexity, cryptography, and the foundations of machine learning. He uses polynomials (continuous functions) to investigate fundamental properties of Boolean(discrete) functions and has also developed new algorithms and lower bound techniques for differentially private data analysis. He spent the 20182019 academic year at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley and will be joining BU as a tenure-track assistant professor in July 2019.
