I am also a member of the Wireless Networking and communications Group . My research interests are in Internet and wireless networking. I graduated with a Ph.D. from Computer Science department at Cornell University in 2001. I spent 2001 - 2004 as a researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA . I joined UT Austin in January 2005. My current research focuses on wireless network management and content distribution in mobile networks. I am named as an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and ACM Distinguished Scientist. I got an NSF CAREER award and Google Faculty Research Award, and best paper awards at ACM MobiSys'18 and IEEE ICNP'17. I have also worked on network measurement and tomography , overlay routing/multihoming , Web performance and content/event distribution , TCP, active queue management, and congestion control , Packet classification and security , and IP telephony .
