Research My research area is operating systems/distributed systems. My current research focuses primarily on cloud infrastructure services and federation (e.g., ExoGENI ), trust management, and security in cloud environments (e.g., Silver ), and automation for cloud-hosted applications (e.g., ADAMANT ). My group also conducts research on network storage, software-defined and end-system networking, and Internet service infrastructures. Some recent works (pdfs): SAFE logical trust , SAFE GENI , ORCA retrospective , ExoGENI federated cloud , supercomputer file system performance (SC 12) , demand response for computing centers Older research overview (2010) Selected publications Activities Editorial Board, CACM Research Highlights Program Committees: NSDI 2013 , NSDI 2015 , SIGCOMM 2015 , SOCC 2015 , NSDI 2016 , OSDI 2016 Co-chair, NSF GENI Control Framework Working Group and member of GENI Architects panel (2010-2014).
