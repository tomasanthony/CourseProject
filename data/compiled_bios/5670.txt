 Geoffrey Smith Professor School of Computing and Information Sciences Florida International University Miami, Florida 33199 USA E-mail: myname@cis.fiu.edu , where myname is smithg . Phone: (305) 348-6037 Office: CASE 320 Research My research interests center on the foundations of computer security and especially on secure information flow, including quantitative measures (e.g. Bayes leakage and g -leakage), applications to cryptography (e.g. timing attacks), and language-based security (e.g. type systems guaranteeing noninterference). Most of my research papers are available here .
