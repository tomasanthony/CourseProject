Sabre Kais Professor of Chemical PhysicsProfessor of Computer Science (courtesy)Joined department: 2005 EducationBS, Hebrew University, (1983) MS, Hebrew University, (1984) PhD, Hebrew University, (1989) Prof. Kais research is in the field of quantum information and computation and quantum phase transitions. In particular, his research focuses on quantifying entanglement, quantum algorithms, teleportation using quantum dots, decoherence in spin systems and solid state implementations of qubits. Prof. Kais received the National Science Foundation Career Award in 1997. He was also awarded the Purdue University Faculty Scholar Award (2004-2009), and the Guggenheim Fellowship Award (2005). In 2007, Prof. Kais was the Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society and the Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Recently, Purdue University received $1.5 million in National Science Foundation (NSF) funding to establish a research center to study quantum information science. The Center for Quantum Information and Computation for Chemistry will investigate information techniques used to gain novel viewpoints on diverse chemical processes from photosynthesis to bond breaking. http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~kais/qc/ Selected PublicationsQing Xu, Sabre Kais, maxim Naumov and Ahmed Sameh, "Exact Calculation of Entanglement in a 19-site 2D Spin System", Phys.
