Jonathan L. Goodall Associate Professor, Civil EngineeringAssociate Professor, Computer Science, by courtesyAssociate Director, Link Lab Bio B.S. University of Virginia, 2001M.S. University of Texas at Austin, 2003Ph.D. University of Texas at Austin, 2005 Jonathan Goodall is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering in the Department of Engineering Systems and Environment at the University of Virginia. He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science. His teaching and research interests are in hydrology, water resources engineering, and hydroinformatics. His primary research focus in on creating new approaches for modeling hydrologic systems for sustainable water management and increased resilience to floods and droughts. Professor Goodall is the recipient of the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award and the International Society for Environmental Modelling & Software (iEMSs) Early Career Research Excellence award. He currently serves as an Associate Editor for Water Resources Research, Environmental Modelling & Software, and the ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering. He is the Associate Director of the interdisciplinary Link Lab, leads the Hydroinformatics Research Group, is a member of the Environmental Resilience Institute steering committee, and is an affiliated faculty member of the Center for Transportation Studies. Prior to joining UVA in the fall of 2013, he held faculty positions at the University of South Carolina-Columbia and Duke University.
