 Derek Nowrouzezahrai Associate Professor NSERC/Ubisoft Industrial Research Chair Electrical & Computer Engineering Computer Science (Associate) Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (Associate) McConnell Eng. Building 3480 University Street Montreal, Quebec Canada H3A 0E9 @DerekRenderling Recent News Luis' work on multiscale microfacet models for complex lighting was accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 ! Congratulations to Olivier on defending his Ph.D. Thesis and starting as Research Scientist at Facebook Reality Labs ! We'll present two papers at SIGGRAPH 2018 and one at Eurographics : integrating spherical harmonic expansions over clipped polygons, gradient domain volumetric rendering, and BRDF manifolds! I'm excited to have granted an NSERC Industrial Research Chair in Collaboration with Ubisoft Montreal , working on believable virtual characters! Congratulations to Olivier on his SIGGRAPH Asia 2017 paper on rendering methods for multi-focal displays! I have joined the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Graphics . We'll present two papers at SIGGRAPH 2017 : Chaitanya's exciting Deep Learning work for Path Tracing, and Laurent's awesome GI filtering paper! We have three papers accepted to EGSR 2017 ! Daniel, Mei and Los started their summer internships. Enjoy the warm weather! Chaitanya, Yangyang, and Nicolas started their PhDs! Keven, Sayantan, Joey, Myriam and Yue join the GIL. Welcome! The Graphics & Imaging Lab (The GIL @ McGill) is alive! I've joined McGill ! Laurent wraps up his Post-Doc and heads to Unity Research ! UPBP was integrated and released in Pixar's Renderman 21 ! Our non-parametric microfacet model was accepted to TOG ! Our work on generalizing k-buffers was accepted to HPG ! Our motion blur work was integrated into Unity . David M. gets his MSc, heads to 8i as a Research Scientist ! I received an Outstanding Young Computer Science Researcher award from the Canadian Association of Computer Science! Our fast spherical filtering work was accepted to TOG ! I've been awarded a Tier-II Canada Research Chair in Realistic Image Synthesis. Just finished co-chairing EGSR . It was a huge hit! Our surface turbulence paper to SIGGRAPH Asia ! 2 papers accepted @ EGSR ! UPBP featured at the International Conference on Transport Theory ! Guofu wraps up his Post-Doc, heads to Baidu ! Mahdi wraps up his Post-Doc, heads to Microsoft ! Aude gets her MSc, heads to Hibernum ! Cihan and Nicolas join the lab. Welcome!
