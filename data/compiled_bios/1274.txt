Elias Bareinboim Assistant Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 2015 EducationPh.D., University of California, Los Angeles, Computer Science (2014) Professor Barenboim's research focuses on causal and counterfactual inference and their applications to data-driven fields (e.g., medicine, economics, cognitive science). Bareinboim is broadly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, robotics, and the philosophy of science. His thesis work was the first to propose a general solution to the problem of "data fusion," and provides practical methods for combining datasets generated under different experimental conditions. Bareinboim recognitions include the AI's 10 to Watch (IEEE), the Dan David Prize Scholarship, the Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Award, and the 2014 AAAI Outstanding Paper Award.
