 Anirudh Sivaraman Assistant Professor of Computer Science 60 5th Avenue, Room 408, New York, NY 10011 anirudh@cs.nyu.edu I am an assistant professor at NYU's Computer Science Department . I am broadly interested in computer networking, and my current research work is in the area of fast and programmable routers . Before coming to NYU, I received a Ph.D. from MIT in 2017, an S.M. from MIT in 2012, and a BTech from IIT Madras in 2010. CV Students I am looking for undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students. My research combines computer networking with other fields such as systems, programming languages, compilers, and hardware design. I am interested in students with a background or interest in any of these areas. If you're interested in a Ph.D., please apply here , and send me an email if you have questions. If you're a masters or undergraduate student at NYU, please send me an email.
