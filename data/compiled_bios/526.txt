One tries to get good upper bounds by exhibiting efficient algorithms and to develop mathematical methods to prove lower bounds. I am especially interested in lower bound techniques for parallel and for probabilistic models. I am also interested in dstributed computing, especially in fault tolerant distributed computations.
