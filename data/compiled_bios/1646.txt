I am affilated with the Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Department at George Mason University. I graduated with a Ph.D. (2008) and M.S. (2005) in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (USA) and a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (2003) in Mumbai, India. I was a Visiting Faculty at the Discovery Analytics Center of Virginia Tech. University , in Artlington, VA, USA (2015-2016). Research Interests My research interests include Data Mining and Machine Learning involving fundamental contributions in the areas of (i) Multi-Task and Transfer Learning (ii) Hierarchical Classification and (iii) Recommender Systems with applications in three broad areas: (i) Biomedical Informatics (ii) Educational Data Mining and (iii) Social Network Analysis My group's focus is on development of novel algorithms, and engineering of effective solutions for real world applications. My research has resulted in development in useful and efficient software that aid inter-disciplinary researchers to make key discoveries, while also producing contributions that have advanced the field of computer science. See our Projects page for details on current and prior projects. Research contributions are possible due to funding by (i) National Science Foundation (NSF) (ii) Navy Research Laboratory (NRL) (iii) National Institutes of Health (NIH) (iv) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) (v) U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and (vi) Google, Inc.
