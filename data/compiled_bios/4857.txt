 Ramin Zabih Professor of Computer Science Research Scientist, Google NYC 607 255 8413 607 255 4428 (fax) Research My research interests lie in computer vision and its applications, especially in medical imaging. I have worked on a variety of problems in early vision, including motion and stereo; many of these problems can be solved very accurately using algorithms based on graph cuts, which was given the Helmholtz Prize at ICCV 2011/13 and the Koenderink prize at ECCV 2012 for contribution that have stood the test of time. I served as a Program Chair for CVPR 2007 (the primary North American vision conference), and for the International Workshop on Computer Vision 2008 , 2010 , 2012 , 2014 , 2016 and 2018 (a small workshop for senior vision researchers), and was a General Chair for CVPR 2013 . I was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence from 2009 through 2012, and from 2013 through mid 2015 I chaired the PAMI-TC , which runs the main vision conferences. I also am the president and founder of the Computer Vision Foundation , a non-profit which now co-sponsors CVPR and ICCV with the IEEE Computer Society, and for which I was awarded the 2016 Everingham Prize . In 2018 I was a general chair for the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), and in 2020 I will be a general chair for CVPR. Since the fall of 2013 I am at CornellNYC Tech with a joint appointment in Weill Cornell Radiology. My medical work has focused on the problem of MR image reconstruction, as well as on workflow issues. During 2016 and 2017 I was on leave at Google Research in NYC, where I now hold an appointment as a research scientist. Students I am particularly proud of two students who returned to Cornell: Ashish Raj , who has a faculty position at Cornell Radiology, and Greg Pass who is the Chief Entrepreneurial Officer at Cornell NYC Tech. My current PhD students are Richard Strong Bowen and Charles Herrmann (in CS) and Akshay Bhat (in IS). Alumni include Yuri Boykov (postdoc), Alex Fix , Chen Wang Jing Huang , Olga Veksler , Vera Kettnaker, Junhwan Kim , Vladimir Kolmogorov , Gurmeet Singh and Jie Zhu (PhD students) and Devin Kennedy, Chris Danis, Brian Rogan, Brian Cody, Justin Miller and Justin Voskuhl (undergraduates).

Teaching At CornellTech I primarily teach masters students, my most recent class is here . While I taught in Ithaca, I developed a new course , originally called CS100R, that uses camera-controlled robots to introduce basic concepts in computer science. I typically taught graduate computer vision , or advanced undergraduate programming . In the more distant past I also taught CS212, an honors-level freshman introduction to CS.
