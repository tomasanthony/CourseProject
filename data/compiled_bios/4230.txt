 Prasad Kulkarni Professor Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Kansas Address: 136 Nichols Hall, EECS, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045. Phone: (785) 864-8819 Email: I received my PHD in Computer Science from the Florida State University in 2007 and am currently an Associate Professor in the EECS department at the University of Kansas. My research interests are in the areas of compilers, computer architecture, and runtime systems (virtual machines). In particular, we focus on building system tools to investigate and solve a variety of interesting problems to enable more efficient and secure program execution on modern multi-core machines and embedded systems. As a student I received the IBM Ph.D. fellowship. I was awarded the NSF's CAREER award in 2010, and KU EECS students awarded me with the Harry Tally Excellence in Teaching Award in 2012 and 2017. I invite you to visit our CARS research group page to find an overview of our research.
