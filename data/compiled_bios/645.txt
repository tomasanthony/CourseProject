 Baris Kasikci's Home Page Baris Kasikci I am interested in making computer systems more reliable, secure, and efficient | CV barisk@umich.edu | GPG Home Research Publications Teaching Contact Bio I am an assistant professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan. My research is centered around developing techniques, tools, and environments that help developers build more reliable, secure, and efficient software. I am interested in developing techniques and building systems that allow programmers to better reason about their code. I am also interested in system support for emerging hardware platforms, efficient runtime instrumentation, hardware and runtime support for enhancing system security, and program analysis. Previously, I was a researcher in the Systems and Networking Group at Microsoft Research Cambridge. I completed my PhD in the Dependable Systems Laboratory (DSLAB) at EPFL, advised by George Candea. I also held roles at Intel, VMware and Siemens. I am the recipient of the 2016 Roger Needham PhD Award for the best PhD thesis in computer systems in Europe and the 2016 Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for best PhD thesis in the Department of Information and Communication Sciences at EPFL. I am one of the recipients of the VMware 2014-2015 Graduate Fellowship. More details can be found in my CV.
