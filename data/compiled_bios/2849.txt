Prabhakar Ragde's Web space	Prabhakar Ragde	I'm a Professor in the School of	Computer Science within the Faculty of Mathematics at the	University of Waterloo. My	work includes research (design and	analysis of algorithms, computational complexity,	theory and practice of functional programming languages), teaching, and committee service.	You may be interested in some	flneries,	online writings based on recent creative course offerings.	I exhibit occasional flashes of interest in travel, food, wine, coffee, music,	books, film,	photography,	theatre, art, and architecture, though not for long enough	to develop any expertise.	This site is text-positive and defiantly retro (hand-crafted HTML	1.0).	This is what I remember.
