 Matt Webster > Home Home Publications Contact Matt Webster Computer Scientist and Postdoctoral Researcher. Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool About I am a postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool . I am currently working on the Science of Sensor Systems Software (S4) programme grant, and the Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA) Hub , both of which are funded by EPSRC. I am a member of the following groups, labs and centres: Robotics and Autonomous Systems group ( Artificial Intelligence section). Verification group ( Artificial Intelligence section). Centre for Autonomous Systems Technology . Autonomy and Verification Laboratory . Virtual Engineering Centre , STFC Daresbury Laboratory. Research My research interests include: Wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Robotics: trustworthy robotics, autonomy, verification, simulation, ROS. Autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems. Formal methods, including model checking, formal semantics of programming languages. Unmanned vehicles: autonomy, certification, networked simulation. Model checking agent programming languages. Computer security and computer virology. Formal modelling of biocomputational systems and artificial life. My previous projects include Trustworthy Robotic Assistants , the Virtual Engineering Centre , and Model Checking Agent Programming Languages . Before those I did a Ph.D. on formal modelling and verification, computer viruses and artificial life ( thesis available in PDF ). A list of my papers and publications can be found here .
