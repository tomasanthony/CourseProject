I am working to restoring the outside access and apologize for the inconvenience. Short Bio Chen Ding's research seeks to understand the composite and emergent behavior in computer systems especially its dynamic parallelism and data usage and develop software techniques for automatic or suggestion-based locality optimization, memory management, and program parallelization. His work received young investigator awards from NSF and DOE. He co-founded the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Memory System Performance and Correctness (MSPC) and was a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research and a visiting professor at MIT. He is also an IBM Center for Advanced Studies Faculty Fellow. He teaches compilation, programming languages, software design and computer organization.
