Research Interests My research focuses on climate informatics , and more specifically, the applications of computer science and software engineering to the challenge posed by global climate change . I have completed a series of case studies of the software development processes used by computational scientists for development of Earth System Models. See for example: Alexander, K. and Easterbrook, S. M. (2015) The software architecture of climate models: a graphical comparison of CMIP5 and EMICAR5 configurations , Geoscientific Model Development , 8, 1221-1232, doi:10.5194/gmd-8-1221-2015. S. M. Easterbrook (2014). Open code for open science? Nature Geoscience , 7(11), 779-781. I am also investigating the role of computational models in teaching key concepts in climate science, and the application of web-based collective intelligence tools to the development of consensus solutions to climate change. Some of this work focusses on the idea of Systems Thinking as a key strategy in understanding. See for example: S. M. Easterbrook (2014) " From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking: A conceptual toolkit for sustainability computing ". Proceedings, Second International Conference on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S 2014) , Stockholm, Sweden, August 24-27, 2014 Becker, C., Chitchyan, R., Duboc, L., Easterbrook, S. M., Penzenstadler, B., Seyff, N., Venters, C., (2015) Sustainability Design and Software: The Karlskrona Manifesto . Proceedings, 37th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering , Florence, Italy, 16-24 May, 2015. My earlier work focussed on systems analysis for complex software-intensive systems, particularly questions such as how the views of different stakeholders can be compared and merged; the role of modelling for understanding and communicating key ideas about systems; software verification and validation and how it affects software quality; and the social and cognitive processes that support coordination within teams of software developers. I'm also interested in the broader question of how software development re-shapes human activities, or more accurately, how human activities and software systems co-evolve, each shaping the other in important ways. See for example: S. M. Easterbrook, E. Yu, J. Aranda, Y. Fan, J. Horkoff, M. Leica, and R. A. Qadir. Do Viewpoints Lead to Better Conceptual Models? An Exploratory Case Study . 13th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE05) , Paris, France, Aug 29 Sep 2 2005. S. M. Easterbrook and M. Chechik, " A Framework for Multi-Valued Reasoning over Inconsistent Viewpoints ", Proceedings, 23rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE-01) , Toronto, Canada, May 12-19, 2001. IEEE Computer Society Press. For a full list of papers, see my publications page Other Projects : How to broaden the education of computer science students - increasing diversity of the undergrad student cohort, improving their ethical and ecological maturity, and equipping them with the skills to engage in inter-disciplinary work. E.g. See for example the work of my student, Elizabeth Patitsas on gender diversity in computer science . Fostering trans-disciplinary research around climate change. E.g. See our trans-disciplinary lecture series ; I'm also interested in how software infrastructures support this Software for collective decision-making around climate change policies. E.g. See the tool we're building to support open collaborative quantitative decision-making The software development processes and software quality factors in climate modeling. E.g. See the results of a recent study on how climate scientists build and validate climate simulations . The November 2011 Special Issue of IEEE Software Research methodologies (and especially empirical research methods) in Software Engineering. E.g. see my grad course on Empirical Methods and a recent book chapter on how to select a research method . Modeling and Reasoning in the Presence of Inconsistency. E.g. see our TOSEM paper on multi-valued model checking and our our ASE'03 paper on model merging My Students MSc students Levon Amantuni PhD students Wei Yu Soukayna Mouatadid Samar Sabie James Williams Alumni Elizabeth Patitsas (now an assistant professor at McGill) Susan Sim (now a lecturer the iSchool, U of Toronto) Mehrdad Sabetzadeh (now a senior research scientist at U Luxembourg) Nan Niu (now an assistant prof at U Cincinnati) Wendy Liu Jorge Aranda (now Lead Scientist at Limbic Consulting) Rick Salay (now a postdoc at U Toronto) Lin Mei Jon Pipitone (Currently studying for his MD at Queens U) Daniel Levy (Now working for IBM) Mahtab Sabet (Now Senior Software Engineer at Capital One in Toronto) Jonathan Lung (Now working at Sojourn Labs , which he co-founded) Some talks and tutorials I have given: A Prezi on The history of climate models .

Other interests My interests include: Our cats were among the first felines to have a web presence (back in '93), but sadly they are no longer with us. We have new cats! But no photos, just in case . We mainly eat kid-friendly food these days, but given the chance I do love to cook (using vegetarian recipes ) Music that sounds good enough to eat: Gazpacho ! Photography. But I haven't yet bought a digital camera don't have time to upload my pictures, so this link doesn't work. Making cakes for the kids . Steve Easterbrook , [Last modified: Jan 15, 2019]
