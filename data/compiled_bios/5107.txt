Never ascribe to malice what you can ascribe to stupidity -- especially your own. -- See Hanlon's Razor and M.N. Plano's version The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men; Gang aft a-gley -- Robert Burns: To a Mouse (original Scots) Love like there is no tomorrow. -- Multiple popular references The perfect is the enemy of the good. -- Voltaire (loosely translated from the French) A PhD doesn't mean you are an expert in any particular subject; it just means that you could become one if you wanted to. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is. -- Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut (attributed) Last modified:27 January 2019
