I received the NSF CAREER Award in 2018. I was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Kentucky , and a faculty member of the Laboratory for Advanced Networking during 2013-2016. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Texas at Austin in 2013. My advisor was Simon S. Lam , meaning I am a part of the Leonard Kleinrock 's family tree . I am the recipient of the James C. Browne Graduate Fellowship in 2012 ( list of Browne Fellowship awardees for 2001-2012). I interned at AT&T Labs-Research in May-Aug, 2012. I got my M.Phil. from Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , where I worked with Prof. Lionel M. Ni (now Provost at University of Macau), and also had close collaboration with Prof. Yunhao Liu (now Dean of School of Engineering, Tsinghua University). I received my Bachelor's degree (highest honor) from Department of Computer Science , Nanjing University in 2006, under the supervision of Prof. Jiafu Xu and Prof. Fangmin Song . I was born in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.
