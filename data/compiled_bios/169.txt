 Menu about research projects research group Lillian J. Ratliff Assistant Professor, EE UW Lillian (Lily) Ratliff is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. Prior to joining UW she was a postdoctoral researcher in EECS at UC Berkeley (2015-2016) where she also obtained her PhD (2015) under the advisement of Shankar Sastry. She holds a MS (UNLV 2010) and BS (UNLV 2008) in Electrical Engineering as well as a BS (UNLV 2008) in Mathematics. Her research interests lie at the intersection of game theory, optimization, and learning. She draws on theory from these areas to develop new theoretical models of human decision-making in societal-scale cyber-physical systems (e.g., intelligent infrastructure) and computational schemes to shape the outcome of competitive interactions. 2018 Lillian Ratliff.
