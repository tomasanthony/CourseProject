 MARYNEL VZQUEZ marynel.vazquez \at\ yale.edu Assistant Professor Yale Computer Science MAIN PUBLICATIONS OPEN POSITIONS TEACHING JackRabbot at BAVM17. Chester, the furniture robot, orchestrates a game of Mafia [HRI'15]. 3D printed pneumatic device control [CHI'15]. Brainstorming session with our furniture robot [HRI'17]. I am a computer scientist and roboticist by training. The goal of my research is to understand how we can build interactive computing technologies that are meaningful, intuitive, and appropriate for users, especially in complex social environments. My research often crosses the boundaries between Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interaction, and combines elements from robotics, social science, and design. I am looking for for highly motivated students to join my group at Yale . If you are interested in working with me on enabling multi-party human-robot interactions, please read this note about open positions at Yale before contacting me. Before joining Yale, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Stanford A.I. Lab with Silvio Savarese . Some of the work that I did at Stanford is described in this GTC'18 presentation by Animesh Garg and I. Prior to Stanford, I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at the Robotics Institute in Carnegie Mellon University. I was very lucky to work with Disney Research while in Pittsburgh. An updated list of my publications can be found here , and in Google Scholar . The code for some of my projects is also hosted in GitHub .
