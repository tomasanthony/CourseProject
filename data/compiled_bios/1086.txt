Page Statistics Back to Top Short CV I received the master degree (summa cum laude) in Computer Science from the University of Salerno (Italy) in 2009. From May 2009 to January 2010 I have been a research fellow at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics of the University of Salerno, Italy. I got my Ph.D. at the same University in February 2013, defending a thesis on Search-Based Approaches for Software Development Effort Estimation. In December 2013, I was appointed as a Research Associate in CREST at University College London to work on the DAASE EPRSC project where I lead the Predictive Modelling theme. I was then promoted to Senior Research Associate at the same institution in February 2016 and to Principal Research Associate in 2017. From August 1st 2017, I have been appointed as a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at University College London, Department of Computer Science. I am currently member of the CREST research centre and the SSE research group, head of the UCLAppA group, and director of the Appredict spin-out. My main research area are Empirical and Search-Based Software Engineering, with specific interest in the definition and the empirical evaluation of Search-Based approaches for predictive modelling in the context of Software Development Effort Estimation and Fault Prediction. I also have been working on Search-Based approaches for project management, functional metrics for sizing software products, Data Mining and Human-Computer Interaction. My recent research interests include mobile App Stores Analys and Automatic Program Repair.

Adams I like being able to learn wherever and whenever I want. S. Singh When we lose the right to be different, we lose the privilege to be free. C. E. Hughes Back to Top Research Interest Search Based Software Engineering The term Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) was first used by Harman and Jones in 2001 . The term "search" is used to refer to the metaheuristic search-based optimization techniques. Search Based Software Engineering seeks a fundamental shift of emphasis from solution construction to solution description. Rather than devoting human effort to the task of finding solutions, the search for solutions is automated as a search, guided by a fitness function, defined by the engineer to capture what is required rather than how it is to be constructed. In many ways, this approach to Software Engineering echoes, at the macro level of Software Engineering artifacts, the declarative programming approach, which applies at the code level; both seek to move attention from the question of "how" a solution is to be achieved to the question of "what" properties are desirable." From "Why the Virtual Nature of Software Makes it Ideal for Search Based Optimization", Mark Harman Empirical Software Engineering "Like physics, medicine, manufacturing, and many other disciplines, software engineering requires the same high level approach for evolving the knowledge of the discipline; the cycle of model building, experimentation and teaming. We cannot rely solely on observation followed by logical thought. Software engineering is a laboratory science. It involves an experimental component to test or disprove theories, to explore new domains. We must experiment with techniques to see how and when they really work, to understand their limits, and to understand how to improve them. We must learn from application and improve our understanding." From "The Role of Experimentation in Software Engineering: Past, Current, and Future", Victor R. Basili Predictive Analytics for Software Engineering Software has nowadays pervaded all aspects of our lives. This allows the production and collection of a large amount of information about people's behaviours and decisions. Predictive analytics is the practice of exploiting such information through intelligent systems able to identify patterns and predict future outcomes and trends. Applied to Software Engineering, predictive analytics can be used to understand software processes, products and customers in order to maximise product quality, users' satisfaction, and revenues. Various automated approaches based on data mining, artificial intelligence, machine or statistical learning have been proved to be useful to this end. Area of applications are, for example, project management , development effort estimation , defect prediction , software testing and app store analysis . by Federica Sarro Back to Top Awards Medal at HUMIES@GECCO 2016 Outstanding Reviewer IST 2016 Best Paper Award at ESEM 2015 .
