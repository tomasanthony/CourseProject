CornellX : INFO2040x: Networks, Crowds and Markets March 2016. Research interest: Algorithms and algorithmic game theory, the subarea of theoretical computer science theory of designing systems and algorithms for selfish users. My research focuses on algorithms and games on networks and simple auctions. I am mostly interested in designing algorithms and games that provide provably close-to-optimal results. Books J.
