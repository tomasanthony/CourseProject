Brad Campbell Assistant Professor Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Bio PhD, University of Michigan, 2017 "How do we power, program, network, manage, and interact with trillions of smart devices? The potential for great impact exists, and my research focuses on designing, building, and deploying systems to answer these questions." Brad Campbell Brad joined the University of Virginia in 2017 as a member of the Link Lab after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. His research interests broadly include wireless embedded systems, with a focus on new energy-harvesting sensors, networks of connected "things", and application-driven sensing systems and deployments.
