 Nicolas Berthier - Welcome Welcome Research Teaching Tools Some links University of Liverpool Departement of Computer Science Ashton Building, Ashton Street Liverpool L69 3BX, United Kingdom @ <firstname>.<lastname>@liverpool.ac.uk +44 151 795 4239 Welcome! I am currently a Research Associate in the Departement of Computer Science of the University of Liverpool . I received my PhD in Computer Science at the Universit Grenoble Alpes , where I was a member of the Synchrone team at the Verimag laboratory . I have also been a postdoctoral fellow in the SUMO team at INRIA Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique . I present on these pages my research (past and present) and teaching activities, as well as related tools I developped, and maintain here an OPAM repository easing the installation and usage of some of these tools. I also expose a pedagogic video-clip I have produced in 2010, with three other PhD students from Grenoble. It illustrates a frequently used reasoning bias called the "Pangloss" effect, by means of some examples involving such errors. Research Interests Discrete Controller Synthesis Algorithms ; Reactive Control Techniques, Models and Programming Languages for Systems Design ; Global Control for Resource and Energy Management; Operating Systems Design and Implementation .
