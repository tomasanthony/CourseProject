 Alper ngr, Ph.D. Associate Professor Bio Alper ngrs research is on the junction of the two main branches of computer science, theoretical computer science and scientific computing. Specifically, his research interests are in computational geometry, with special emphasis in mesh generation. His main goal is to understand the mathematical (mostly geometrical) structure of engineering problems and develop provably good algorithms to solve them. There are many application domains computer graphics, computer-aided design, computer vision, robotics, scientific computing, computational biology and geographic information systems and others- in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. During his Ph.D. studies at the University of Illinois, he has mainly focused on the geometric problems arising in finite element mesh generation. During his postdoctoral studies at Duke University, he was involved in the BioGeometry project, an interdisciplinary effort to address fundamental computational problems in the representation of molecular structures and the simulation of biochemical processes important to life.
