This project will transform the streams of social media chatter at hundreds of news outlets into data signals and mine those signals foretelling the imminence of an (important) event, and to develop sound predictive analytics on top of those signals. more ... Prof. Zoran Obradovic is General Chair and Principal Investigator of the NSF US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop Grant. This workshop will facilitate closing the gap between data science research in the US and Serbia and the region and will bring together data scientists with researchers from disciplines that until recently had little exposure to data science methods, potentially enabling collaborative breakthroughs in those scientific fields. more ...
