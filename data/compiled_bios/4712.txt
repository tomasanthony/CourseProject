He is specialized in power electronics and motor drives area, and has given extensive contributions in power converters, PWM techniques, electric/hybrid vehicle drives, microprocessor/DSP control, system simulation, renewable energy systems, and application of artificial intelligence techniques (expert system, fuzzy logic and neural network) in power electronics and drives systems. He served as a visiting professor in Federal University of Mato Grosso Sul (1989), Brazil; Aalborg University (1997), Denmark; Padova University (2003), Italy; Sevilla University (2008), Spain; and European Ph.D. School (2010), Italy. He has been power electronics consultant in a large number of industries. Dr. Bose has authored and co-authored more than 250 papers and holds 21 U.S. patents. He has authored/edited seven books in power electronics: Power Electronics and Motor Drives Advances and Trends (Elsevier/Academic Press, 2006), Modern Power Electronics and AC Drives (Prentice-Hall, 2001), Power Electronics and AC Drives (Prentice-Hall, 1986), Power Electronics and Variable Frequency Drives (Wiley/IEEE Press, 1997), Modern Power Electronics (IEEE Press, 1992), Microcomputer Control of Power Electronics and Drives (IEEE Press, 1987), and Adjustable Speed AC Drive Systems (IEEE Press, 1981). The books have been translated in several foreign languages. Dr. Bimal K. Bose: A Reference for Generations globally promoted power electronics, not only by his research publications and books, but also through his endless tutorial presentations, invited seminars, IEEE Distinguished Lectures and keynote addresses throughout the world comments IEEE IES Magazine Editor (June 2009). The IEEE IE Society Magazine (June 2009) honored him by publishing a Special Issue Honoring Dr. Bimal Bose and Celebrating His Contributions in Power Electronics with his photo on front cover. Dr. Bose has served the IEEE in various capacities, including Member of the IEEE Awards Board, Member of the IEEE Medal in Power Engineering Committee, Chairman of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES) Power Electronics Council, Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE IECON Power Electronics Chairman, Chairman of the IEEE Industry Applications Society (IAS) Industrial Power Converter Committee, IAS Member of the Neural Network Council, Vice-Chair of the IEEE Medals Council, Vice-Chair of the IAS Distinguished Lecture Program, Member of IEEE-USA Energy Policy Committee, Member of the IEEE Fellow Committee, Member of IEEE Lamme Medal Committee, Member of the Editorial Board of the Proceedings of the IEEE, and Member of IEEE Spectrum Advisory Board. He was the Guest Editor of the Proceedings of the IEEE (Special Issue of Power Electronics and Motion Control, August 1994), and Special Section Editor of IEEE Transactions of Industrial Electronics (Neural Network Applications in Power Electronics and Motor Drives, February 2006). Dr. Bose has B.E. degree in 1956 from BESU, India, M.S. degree in 1960 from University of Wisconsin, Madison,, and D. Phil degree in 1966 from Calcutta University. Among his many philanthropic activities, he donated the IETE (Institute of Electronics and Tele-Communications Engineers, India) Power Electronics Award, BESU Distinguished Lecture Award, and 32 scholarships with library, seminar hall and open stage for his village school. He also contributed for EE Dept. of UTK and village development programs in India.
