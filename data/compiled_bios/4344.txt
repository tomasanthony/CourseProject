Liqun Kuang, Xie Han, Kewei Chen, Richard J. Caselli, Eric M. Reiman, Yalin Wang We propose a threshold-free feature by integrating a prior persistent homology-based topological feature (the zeroth Betti number) and a newly defined connected component aggregation cost feature to model brain networks over all possible scales. We show that the   View           Liang Mi's ECCV Paper Got Accepted,  Congratulation!   A new clustering method which solves the k-means clustering problem with variational optimal transportation. It leverages power Voronoi diagram to aggregate empirical observations into a fixed number of Voronoi cells while maintaining the minimum transportation cost and preliminary results have shown its applications in domain adaptation,   View        More             699 S Mill AveTempe, AZ 85281      ylwang@asu.edu        4809656871     2019 Geometry Systems Laboratory                   Sign In / Sign Out    Sign In     Menu    ASU Home  My ASU   Colleges & Schools   Arts and Sciences  Business  Design and the Arts  Education  Engineering  Future of Innovation in Society  Graduate  Health Solutions  Honors  Journalism  Law  Nursing and Health  Public Service and Community Solutions  Sustainability  University College  Thunderbird School of Global Management     Map & Locations   Map  Tempe  West  Polytechnic  Downtown Phoenix  Online and Extended  Lake Havasu  Skysong  Research Park  Washington D.C.
