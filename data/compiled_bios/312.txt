(09/2015) NSF funds our self-powered pipeline monitoring work. About Me I'm an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University where I teach Computer Science and lead the PERSIST Research Lab . I am always looking for smart, motivated students , but please read this first. [My CV] [My Academic Geneology] [YouTube] Where I post videos, some of which are related to my classes and research. My Research My work makes embedded systems , mobile sensors , wearables , and other small computational things smaller, more efficient, lower cost, longer-lasting, and easier to deploy. My students and I develop and deploy new hardware and software technologies, tools, and abstractions that help embedded devices adapt to changing conditions, recover from frequent power failures, and operate maintenance-free for decades. Projects: System Support for Batteryless Sensors( federated energy storage , Ekho , and Mementos ), wearable security and privacy (Amulet) , Perpetual Systems ( Tula , Eon ), and Hierarchical Power Management ( Turducken , Triage ).

Edwards Middle School I teach an embedded electronics and programming mini-course to 7th and 8th-grade students, who don't yet know that embedded computing is supposed to be hard. So far, my young friends and I have created rhythmic light shows, smart flashlights, heart-rate monitoring programs, and galvanic skin response(GSR)-based "lie detectors" (and they learn that lie detectors don't actually detect lying).
