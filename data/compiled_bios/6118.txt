Tomislav Bujanovic Associate Teaching Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-125 CST 315.443.4583 [email&#160;protected] Degree(s): Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering Lab/Center Affiliation(s): Smart Grid Lab Smart Grid and Power Engineering Lab at Syracuse University has been developed to support teaching and research in contemporary Power Engineering. Power Engineering Lab section has been designed for basic and advanced teaching and research in Power Electronics, Sensors &amp; Measurements, Electromechanical Devices, including control systems, communication, and signal processing aspects. The advanced power electronics boards, supported by the real-time interfaces, are equipped for modern undergraduate and graduate level contemporary experimentation in power electronics and electromechanical devices. Smart Grid Lab section enables continued development of a multidisciplinary research concept that includes advances in communication and control systems, cyber-security, privacy, and economics. This section consists of the setups for electrical transmission and distribution system, solar and wind energy integration, and synchrophasor measurement technology implementation. Smart Home Lab section has been designed for building wired and wireless communication infrastructure and algorithm development for future smart home ideas. The lab is equipped with smart metering infrastructure, providing state-of-the-art environment to our researchers. Distant learning concept implementation in Smart Grid Lab has been developed to enable the on-line lectures and student presentations, as well as the distant lab experiment demonstrations.
