Some people see things others cannot, and they are wrong, and we call them mentally ill. - Nancy Andreasen Biographical Sketch Arvind Easwaran is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. He received a PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, in 2008. Prior to joining NTU in 2013, he has been an Invited Research Scientist at the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal, between 2009 and 2010, and a Research & Development Scientist at Honeywell Aerospace, USA, between 2010 and 2012. He is a ACM Distinguished Speaker since 2018 and a Cluster Director in the Future Mobility Solutions research programme at the Energy Research Institute @ NTU.

Research Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass systems in which the cyber world of computation and communication closely interacts with the physical world of sensors and actuators. These are highly networked and deeply embedded systems such as those found in modern day aircrafts, automotives, factories, medical devices, smart phones, electric grids, etc. From driver-less cars and air traffic management using sense and avoid, to plug-and-play operating rooms and smart electric grids that integrate traditional and renewable energy sources, intelligent automation of an enormous scale is finding its way into many of these systems. Arvind's current research interests are in the design of cyber-infrastructures for CPS, especially for systems with time-critical functionalities. His research themes can be broadly classified as follows: Real-Time Systems Model-based Design Methodologies Energy Management For further details, please visit CPS Research Group @ SCSE,NTU .
