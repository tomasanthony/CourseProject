 Professor Faith Ellen Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA M5S 3G4 Office : Sandford Fleming 2302C Email : faith at cs dot toronto dot edu Phone : (416) 978 6183 Fax : (416) 946 8498 My research is in the theory of distributed computing. I particularly like proving lower bounds on the complexity of concrete problems with the goal of understanding how parameters of various models of computation affect their computational power. I also study data structures in distributed and sequential models.
