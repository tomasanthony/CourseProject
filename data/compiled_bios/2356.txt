I am a Lecturer in Secure Systems at University of Surrey. Before this, I was a Marie Skodowska-Curie (MSCA) Fellow at the Secure Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Surrey. My research focuses on (automatic) analysis of security using mainly logic-based formalisms, as well as on provable security and applied cryptography. I obtained my PhD in formal verification of security protocols from Imperial College London (2011), and my BSc in computing, vale dictorian, from Faculty of Computer Science, "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University, Iai, Romnia (2007). I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher in LASEC (Laboratory of Security and Cryptography) at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. In 2012, I became deputy director of the lab and a lecturer ("charge de cours") in security and cryptography. In 2013, I was appointed Professor of Information Security at the University of Applied Sciences, Western Switzerland. I then spent a year in industry working as a security architect at Akamai. I was awarded an H2020 MSCA fellowship in 2015, which I began at Imperial College London, before moving to University of Surrey in 2016.10.04.18Read more01.02.17Read moreSee http://people.itcarlson.com/ioana/publications.html
