Education PhD 2013: University of Cincinnati, Computer Science and Engineering BS 2007: University of Cincinnati, Computer Engineering Teaching Interests & Current Courses Taught I am currently teaching two upper-level Computer Science Courses: Computer Security Data Mining In addition to collegiate-level Computer Security and Data Mining, I am passionate about teaching the foundations of computer science at all levels, and a portion of my research focus is on teaching CS to novices K-16 and beyond. Some other collegiate level courses that I have taught include: VLSI Design Automation Instructional Planning Practicum Embedded System Security Research Interests I'm currently interested in the manipulation, anomaly detection, and security of data within hardware systems. Specifically, I am interested in: Information Discovery: Enable the discovery of information in complex data sets (e.g. biological sequences, financial and travel records, social media, astronomical audio/visual spectrum, etc.) using manipulation and anomaly detection algorithms derived from the emergent patterns of the data sets creation; and Information Masking: Secure information by manipulating data sets (e.g. biological sequences, swarm interaction, hardware devices, etc.) by focusing on and eliminating the relationship between a data source and its creation and instantiation.
