Neely received B.S. degrees in both Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1997. He was then awarded a 3 year Department of Defense NDSEG Fellowship for graduate study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received an M.S. degree in 1999 and a Ph.D. in 2003, both in Electrical Engineering. He joined the faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California in 2004, where he is currently an Associate Professor. His research interests are in the areas of stochastic network optimization and queueing theory, with applications to wireless networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, and switching systems. Michael received the NSF Career award in 2008 and the Viterbi School of Engineering Junior Research Award in 2009. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi and Phi Beta Kappa. Research SummaryMIke's research is in the area of stochastic network optimization.  This includes analysis and design for wireless networks, computer networks, ad-hoc mobile networks, and general queueing systems.  Examples of his work include energy and throughput efficient scheduling in networks with random events and an unpredictable future.Awards2013 Okawa Foundation 2012 Research Grant Award from the Okawa Foundation2009 Viterbi School of Engineering Viterbi School of Engineering Junior Faculty Research Award, 20092008 IEEE IEEE Senior Member2008 National Science Foundation NSF Career Award2000  Department of Defense (DoD) Fellowship Award for Graduate Study-  Member of Phi Beta Kappa (accepted as Junior), Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa NuAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Systems OfficeEEB 520Hughes Aircraft Electrical Engineering Center3740 McClintock Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 2565 Contact Information(213) 740-3505mjneely@usc.eduWebsitesResearch Website"]
