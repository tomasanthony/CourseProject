Tomasz Imieliski is a Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University.His joint paper with Agrawal and Swami, 'Mining Association Rules Between Sets of Items in Large DataBases' initiated the Association rule miningresearch area, and is one of the most cited publications in computer science, with over 18,000 citations. This paper received in the 2003 - 10 year Test of Time ACM SIGMOD Award,and is included in the List of importand publications in computer science.Imieliskihas also been one of the pioneers of mobile computing and for his joint paper with Badri Nath, 'Querying in highly mobile distributed environments', he and Badri Nath received 2002 VLDB Ten Year Award.He contributed the area of Geocastthat deals with the delivery of information to a group of destination in a networkidentified by their geographical locations. It is a specialized form of multicastaddressing used by some routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.He explored geographic messaging, geographic advertising, delivery of geographically restricted services, and presence discovery of a service or mobile network participant in a limited geographic area, in his work with Navas, on "GeoCast - Geographic Addressing and Routing".Imieliski's early work on 'Incomplete Information in Relational Databases'produced a fundamental concept that became later known asImieliski-Lipski Algebras.Overall, Imieliski has published over 150 papers and is an inventor and co-inventor on multiple patents ranging from search technology to web data extraction as well as multimedia processing, data mining, and mobile computing.His papers have been cited over 34000 timesTomasz Imieliski has been listed as #3, in the area of databases, on the AMiner Most Influential Scholars Listwhich tracks the top researchers in computer science and engineering.He has served as chairman of Computer Science Department at Rutgers from 1996 till 2003. In 2000 he co-founded Connotate Technologies  web data extraction company based in New Brunswick NJ. Since 2004 till 2010 he has held multiple positions at Ask.com, from Vice president of data solutions to Executive Vice President of global search and answers and Chief Scientist. He has also served as VP of Data Solutions atIAC/Pronto.Specialties: Data mining. Search engine technology. Data extraction.
