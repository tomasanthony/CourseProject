Pisano is a highly accomplished mechanical engineer who, in 2001, was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the design, fabrication, commercialization, and educational aspects of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A self-described technology polymath, Pisano's research is driven by his passion for developing, mastering and advancing technologies in order to solve problems. One of Pisano's new projects is development of an inexpensive yet rugged sensor system that will predict landslides in the Philippines, a country where landslides are a deadly, national problem. Download a PDF presentation on some of Pisano's harsh environment sensor research. At UC San Diego, Pisano holds faculty appointments in the departments of mechanical and aerospace engineering and electrical and computer engineering . Dean Albert P.
