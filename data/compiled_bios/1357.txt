John R. Rice W. Brooks Fortune Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Computer ScienceProfessor of Mathematics (courtesy)Joined department: 1964 EducationBS, Oklahoma State University, Mathematics (1954) MS, Oklahoma State University, Mathematics (1956) PhD, California Institute of Technology, Mathematics (1959) Professor Rice is founder of the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software and is on several other editorial boards. He is the past chair of the Computing Research Association, a fellow of the AAAS, and the ACM, and he is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. For 25 years, Professor Rice has analyzed numerical methods and problem solving environments for scientific computing. He has created a general methodology for performance evaluation of mathematical software and developed the ELLPACK system for elliptic problems. It was extended to Parallel ELLPACK and PDELab. Professor Rice has published 30 books. Among these are: Solving Elliptic Problems with ELLPACK (1985), Mathematical Aspects of Scientific Software (1988), Expert Systems for Scientific Computing (North Holland, 1992), Enabling Technologies for Computational Science (Kluwer, 2000). He has published about 300 journal articles and has 6 patents in computer security. The most recent articles were in the areas of agent-based computing, computational science, computer security, mathematical software, problem solving environments, scientific simulation and web-based computing. In addition to the projects appearing in the Research Funding section, he has received external funding for "Effectiveness of Software Projection Methods" (with Mike Atallah and Buster Dunsmore), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 11/1/02 - 11/1/03, $950,000; "Automatically Protecting Software Against 'diff' Attacks" (with Mike Atallah and David M'Raihi), SBIR Department of Defense, 8/12/03 - 1/31/04, $250,000; and "Tools for Quantifying Software Vulnerabilities and Protection" (with Mike Atallah), Indiana 21st Century Fund, 4/1/04 - 4/1/05, $1,178,256. Most recently he has devised and patented methods to prevent the piracy of software and of digital data. Selected PublicationsJohn Rice, Basic Vita& Publications
