My primary research interests are in social computing, information retrieval, data science, and cybersecurity over large-scale networked information systems like the Web, social media, crowdfunding, and crowd-based systems. My research focus has both positive and negative dimensions. On one hand, I focus on threats to these systems and design methods to mitigate negative behaviors; on the other, I look for positive opportunities to mine and analyze these systems for developing next generation algorithms and architectures that can empower decision makers.
