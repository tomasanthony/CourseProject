Therese Biedl	Professor	David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science.	University of Waterloo	200 University Ave West	Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada	Office: DC 2341	Phone: 519-888-4567 x 34721	My main research interest lies	in algorithms for geometric problems, in particular in	computational geometry and planar graphs.	CV (PDF) (as of December 2018)	I teach courses at all levels, from	1st year CS to graduate courses. Courses I taught recently include	cs240	(Data Structures and Data Management), and	cs762	(Graph-theoretic algorithms).	I supervise students at all levels. To apply:	Undergraduate students: Check the URA web page;	if no positions with me are listed then I currently have none available.	Master's and PhD: You must apply through the	official application web site; else I will not consider your application. Direct emails to me will be deleted without consideration.	Postdocs and short-term visitors: Contact me by email. (Hint: If I haven't met you or your supervisor,	the answer is very likely "no".)
