 Nadia Heninger Associate Professor Computer Science and Engineering University of California, San Diego Email: nadiah at cs dot ucsd dot edu My primary research interests are in cryptography and security, with particular interest in cryptography in practice, cryptanalysis, privacy, lattices, computational number theory, and coding theory. I am currently on leave as a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, MA until July 2019. From 2013 until 2018, I was an assistant professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. Before then, I was a postdoctoral visiting researcher at Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, MA, and an NSF mathematical sciences postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. I have a Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University and a B.S. in electrical engineering and computer science from UC Berkeley. curriculum vitae short bio bigger picture Teaching At the University of Pennsylvania: CIS 331: Introduction to Networks & Security Fall 2017 , Spring 2017 , Spring 2016 , Spring 2015 , Spring 2014 CIS 556: Cryptography Fall 2018 , Fall 2016 , Fall 2015 , Fall 2014 CIS 800: Topics in Cryptography Fall 2013 CIS 800: Security Reading Group 2013-2018 .
