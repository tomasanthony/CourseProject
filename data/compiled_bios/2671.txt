 SLOBODAN VUCETIC Professor Department of Computer and Information Sciences Temple University Address : 1925 N. 12 th St., 304A SERC Philadelphia, PA 19122-6094 Telephone : (215) 204-5535 Fax : (215) 204-5082 Email : vucetic ( at ) temple.edu Office : 314 SERC Resume News: Ranking of the U.S. Computer Science Doctoral Programs Our new study revealed that U.S. News ranking of CS doctoral programs, which is based purely on peer assessment, is surprisingly highly correlated with faculty citations. Our resulting ranking is available here . Research Interests Research Areas : Cognitive Computing Data Science Machine Learning Big Data I am interested in solving real-life knowledge discovery problems through development of novel machine learning algorithms. I am also interested in building software that has intelligent behavior and can enhance human capabilities. My research is driven by open data science problems in a wide array of disciplines such as Public Health, Medicine, Biology, Geosciences, Education, Marketing, Social Sciences, Traffic Engineering, and Industrial Engineering.
