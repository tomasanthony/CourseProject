Fellow of Robinson College . Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute . Contact Info : anuj.dawar cl.cam.ac.uk Department of Computer Science and Technology University of Cambridge J.J. Thomson Avenue Cambridge CB3 0FD, England. Phone: +44 1223 334408 Fax: +44 1223 334678 Office: FE20 External Professional Roles: I am serving on the award committee for the EATCS and ACM SigACT Gdel Prize . I served as president of the European Association for Computer Science Logic for five years until the end of 2017. In this capacity, I also chaired the jury for the Ackermann Award During 2016, I co-organised a semester on Logical Structures in Computation at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley. I am on the advisory board for the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms . I am on the steering committees for LICS , WoLLIC , and LCC . In 2014 and 2015, I served as chair of the jury for the ACM-India Doctoral Dissertation Award . I served as principal organiser of the programme on Logic and Algorithms at the Isaac Newton Institute of Mathematical Sciences from 16 January to 7 July 2006. You can read the final report of the programme here . Research Interests: I am mainly interested in applications of logic in Computer Science. I am especially interested in those areas of theoretical computer science where logical and combinatorial methods combine in the study of algorithms. These include finite model theory and its connection to the study of computational complexity; the theory of databases; the complexity of games and the expressive power of logical formalisms. Papers: A list of selected publications, including some available electronically is here. Here is the list of my papers at DBLP . I regularly write reviews for Mathematical Reviews . Talks: Slides from some recent talks I have given are here . Research Students: I am supervising the following students for their PhD. Gregory Wilsenach Danny Vagnozzi Adam Conghaile Students who have previously completed the PhD under my supervision are: David Richerby (2003) Pablo Arrighi (2004) Paul Hunter (2007) Timos Antonopoulos (2009) Bjarki Holm (2011) Yuguo He (2011) Arno Pauly (2012) Jannis Bulian (2016) Pengming Wang (2018) Editorial Work: I serve on the editorial board of: ACM Transactions on Computational Logic Computability Journal of Computer and System Sciences FoLLI LNCS series and served for nine years as reviews editor of the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic . Meetings: Some conferences, workshops and the like I'm currently involved in. ICLA 2019 (PC member) LiCS 2018 (PC co-chair) CiE 2018 (PC member) CSL 2017 (PC member) ICALP 2017 (PC member) FoSSaCS 2017 (PC member) ICLA 2017 (PC member) CSR 2017 (PC member) Highlights 2016 (PC member) ACM-India Annual Event, 2016 (Keynote Speaker) BLC 2015 (PC chair) TTCS 2015 (Invited Speaker) I was the principal local organiser of the Turing Centenary Conference: CiE 2012 - How the World Computes . Teaching: During Michaelmas 2018, I am giving lectures on Quantum Computing for Part 2 students. During Easter 2019, I am giving lectures on Complexity Theory for Part 1B students. Other courses I've lectured in the past include: Computation Theory for Part 1B students. Topics in Logic and Complexity for Part 3 and the MPhil ACS. Database Theory for Part 2 students Regular Languages and Finite Automata for Part 1A students Introduction to Functional Programming for Part 2 (general) and Diploma students Foundations of Functional Programming for Part 1B. During Lent 2002, I lectured (jointly with Martin Hyland) a Part III Mathematics course on Infinite and Finite Model Theory. Some notes for the course can be found here . MPhil ACS, Part III and Part II projects: If you are interested in pursuing a Master's level research project with me, some ideas for projects I would be happy to supervise can be found here . Some of these may also be adaptable as Part II projects and are indicated as such. Last modified: 28 November 2018. 2018 Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge
