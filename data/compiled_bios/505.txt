Alexander A. Razborov Andrew MacLeish Distinguished Service ProfessorDepartments of Computer Science and Mathematics Adjoint Professor,Toyota Technological Institute Email: razborov@cs.uchicago.edu Phone: (773) 702-3497 Office: JCL 242 Website: people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/ Research: discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, theory Research My primary research area is complexity theory, and I am specifically interested in circuit complexity, proof complexity, quantum computations and communication complexity. Previously I worked in combinatorial group theory, and I still keep some interest there. At the moment I am also actively exploring certain areas in discrete mathematics, notably extremal combinatorics; for more detailed description see the bottom of the page http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/teaching/index.html.
