\r     \r     About me:\r     I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science\r       at the University of Chicago. I am broadly interested in discrete\r       mathematics and particularly interested in computational\r       complexity theory. I love thinking about problems in my head and I\r       am most driven when there is something I feel should be true and I\r       am trying to figure out how to prove it, which is probably why\r       I\'ve been attracted to lower bounds like a moth to a flame. My\r       current research is on the sum of squares hierarchy, a hierarchy\r       of semidefinite programs which is one of the most powerful tools\r       known for combinatorial optimization problems.\r     \r     Contact info:\r     Email address: potechin at uchicago dot edu\r     Here is my current CV.\r     SOS course:\r     The course website for my fall 2018 class on SOS is here
