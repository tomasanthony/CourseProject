This project is motivated by work of David Russinoff originallyat AMD and now at Intel. Continuing the formalization of various sequences and series in ACL2(r). Of particular interest are the convergence and divergence of summations of reciprocals of various setsof numbers, e.g., primes. Proving Lindemanns theorem andthe transcendence of e and  in ACL2(r). This project is in support of a practical verification effort at Intel. Exploring the formalization of analog circuits in ACL2(r). This project is of interest to engineers at Centaur Technology, who use formal methods to reason about digital designs and would like a similar supportfor analog design.
