Voicu S. Popescu Associate Professor of Computer Science Joined department: 2001 EducationBS, University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Computer Science (1995) MS, University of North Carolina, Computer Science (1999) PhD, University of North Carolina, Computer Science (2001) Professor Popescu's research interests span the areas of computer graphics, visualization, and computer vision. His current research projects develop novel camera models for efficient and effective rendering of complex visual effects, a system for rapid photorealistic 3D modeling of large-scale real-world environments, a system that aims to make distance education an integral but unobtrusive part of on-campus education, and a method for high-fidelity general-purpose-visualization of large-scale computer simulations.
