 Nika Haghtalab Microsoft Research, New England. Department of Computer Science, Cornell University. about research activities teaching contact I am a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, New England. In summer 2019, I will join the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University as an Assistant Professor. My research is on the theoretical aspects of machine learning and algorithmic economics. I am especially interested in developing a theory for machine learning that accounts for its interactions with people and organizations, and the wide variety of social and economic limitations, aspiration, and behavior they demonstrate. I recently received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunte to be co-advised by Avrim Blum and Ariel Procaccia. My honors include the CMU School of Computer Science Dissertation award (2018), a Microsoft Research fellowship, a Facebook fellowhsip, an IBM fellowship, and a Siebel scholarship.
