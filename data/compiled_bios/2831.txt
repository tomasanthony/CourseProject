Kate Larson | University of Waterloo	Kate Larson	Professor	Cheriton School of Computer Science	University of Waterloo	Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1	Office: DC 2518	Phone: 519 888 4567 x37760	Email: firstname.lastname@uwaterloo.ca	Site menu:	Home	Publications	Students	Teaching	CV	Contact	Research Interests	Key Words: Artificial Intelligence, Multiagent Systems,	Electronic Commerce, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Automated	Negotiation, Coalition Formation, Normative Models of Bounded	Rationality, Resource Bounded Reasoning	I am interested in issues that arise in settings where	self-interested agents interact. I work with ideas that lie in	the intersection of artificial intelligence, game theory and	microeconomics.	In particular, I am interested in understanding how	computational limitations influence strategic behavior in	multiagent systems, as well as developing approaches to	overcome computational issues which arise in practical	applications of mechanism design. Applications of my work	range from electronic market design to incentive-based	computing.	Short Bio	I am a professor in the Cheriton School of	Computer Science at the University of	Waterloo. I am affiliated with the AI group.	I completed my Ph.D in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon	University. My undergraduate degree was in	mathematics from Memorial	University of Newfoundland.
