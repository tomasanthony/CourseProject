 Rafael Pass Professor Department of Computer Science Cornell University and Cornell Tech Ph.D , MIT , 2006 first name at cs.cornell.edu Cornell Tech, 2 W Loop Rd New York, NY 10044 Summary I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University and at Cornell Tech . I obtained my Ph.D in 2006 in the Theory of Computation group at MIT with Silvio Micali as advisor. Previously, I completed my Licentiate Thesis (M.S.) under the supervision of Johan Hastad . My research focuses on Cryptography and its interplay with Computational Complexity and Game Theory; lately, I have become increasingly interested in the theoretical foundations of blockchains . My work has been supported by a NSF Career Award, a Microsoft Faculty Fellowship , an AFOSR Young Investigator Award, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship , a Wallenberg Academy Award, a Google Faculty Award, as well as grants from AFOSR, BSF and DARPA. My CV: pdf (Aug 2017) Lecture Notes R.
