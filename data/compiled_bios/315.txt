Prior to that, he held a postdoctoral position in the visualization department of the Zuse Institute Berlin , internships at Interval Research (Palo Alto) and Sony CSL (Tokyo), and has been a visiting lecturer at Hong Kong Polytechnic 's School of Design . His research interests include tangible interfaces, computational genomics (and more broadly, interactive computational STEAM), visualization, and rapid physical and electronic prototyping. He also has a strong interest in computationally-mediated art, craft, and design, rooted in the traditions and material expressions of specific regions and cultures. His previous homepages (with much more content) are at LSU , ZIB , and the MIT Media Lab , and a partially created alternate homepage .
