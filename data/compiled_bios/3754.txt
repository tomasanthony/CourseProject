Other assigned duties performed during the academic year and approximate hours/week: Director, Industrial Liaison and Technology Development Office 20 hours per week 13. Improved teaching and professional competence during last five years: During the last 5 years, I and students have worked on the development of a powerful robot simulation system called ROBOSIM. Using this software package, students are able to design their own robots, positioners, and workspace environments, incorporate inverse kinematics, and test their designs in high-speed graphical animation.
