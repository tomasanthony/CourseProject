Tingting Chen Assistant Professor Computer Science Department California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Buidling 8 Room 9, 3801 West Temple Anenue, Pomona, CA, 91768 Email: tingtingchen AT csupomona.edu Short Bio I am currently an assistant professor in Computer Science Department , at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona . I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from Computer Science and Engineering Department , at State University of New York at Buffalo , in June 2011. I received my M.S. degree and B.S. degree both in Computer Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology , China, in 2006 and 2004 respectively. From August 2011 to June 2014 I worked as an assistant professor in Computer Science Department, Oklahoma State University. Research Area My current research interests include economic incentives in wireless networks, data privacy, health informatics and cyber-security. My current research has been supported by California State Polytechnic University, Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology, Amazon Inc, and Oklahoma State University. I am looking for self-motivated graduate and undergraduate students to work with me in the above areas. Please send me your resume and transcripts if interested. Publications Journal Papers A. S.
