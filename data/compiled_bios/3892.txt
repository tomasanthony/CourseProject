 Joshua A. Levine Notes News Publications Teaching Im an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Arizona . Im a member of UAs HDC Lab . I work with an awesome research group: Jixian Li (PhD) , Kairong Jiang (PhD) , and Simon Swenson (PhD) (co-advised with Kobus Barnard ). I also co-advise Devin Bayly (an undergrad in NSCS ). Alumni of my group . I used to profess at Clemson University . I am a postdoctoral alumnus of University of Utah s Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute with Valerio Pascucci and Ross T. Whitaker . I did my PhD at the Ohio State University with Tamal K. Dey and my undergraduate and MS at Case Western Reserve University with Michael S. Branicky . Here is my short bio . I research visualization and geometric modeling. Along the way, I use topological analysis, high-performance computing, and computer graphics. I write code for my research, including contributions to TTK , Cleaver , DelPSC , and DelIso . My recent work has been funded by: DOE, on my Early Career Research Program award Analyzing Multifaceted Scientific Data with Topological Analytics (DE-SC0019039). Previous (now completed) funded projects by: NSF, on our collaborative award Coupled Simulation and Mesh Generation using Computational Topology ( IIS-1654221 , previously IIS-1314757 ).
