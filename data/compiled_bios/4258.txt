I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013. Previously, I worked at Samsung Electronics as a senior system software engineer. I enjoy reading and running . [ CV ] Research My research goal is to build predictable, robust, and high performance computing infrastructure (OS, architecture, and middleware) for embedded real-time systems. My research interests include: Embedded multicore, GPU, heterogenous systems resource management Reliability and security of cyber-physical systems Please check out Projects for more details of my current/past research projects. I am looking for motivated PhD students who are interested in systems research. Experiences and interests in FPGA, heterogeneous architecture, Linux kernel, security, and intelligent robots (e.g., self-driving cars, UAVs) are valued. Please contact me if you are interested and have solid background on modern computer architecture and OS. [ Google Scholar ] [ DBLP ] [ GitHub ] News Jan. 2019.
