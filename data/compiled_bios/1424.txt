 Reza SHOKRI Assistant Professor Computer Science Department National University of Singapore (NUS) Email : firstname@comp.nus.edu.sg Twitter : @rzshokri Phone : +65-651-64464 Office : COM2-03-60 Mailing Address : Dept. of Computer Science, NUS School of Computing, 13 Computing Drive, Computing 1, #03-27, Singapore 117417. My research is in computer security and privacy. My current focus is on machine learning and data privacy , adversarial machine learning , interpretable machine learning , and privacy-preserving data synthesis . I have open positions for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and long-term interns. PhD candidates need to first get admission from the computer science department. Please feel free to email me after you get the admission, and I will be happy to talk to you about our current projects. International students can also apply for the SINGA award . Postdoc candidates need to have strong analytical skills in statistics, probability, and machine learning. Knowledge in cryptography is a plus. Please send me your CV and research statement. Undergraduate students (of other universities) who are exceptionally good in algorithms and are interested in working with me as an intern need to fill out this form . I am also open to working with talented NUS undergraduate students who are interested in working on research projects. Please feel free to email me.
