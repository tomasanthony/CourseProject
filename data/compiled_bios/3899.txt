 CARLOS SCHEIDEGGER BLOG COURSES CODE VIS WRITING PAPERS ABOUT CV CV , scholar , email , twitter , instagram , flickr , g+ , facebook I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. I work in large-scale data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Before coming to sunny , beautiful Tucson , I worked at AT&T Research in New York. Interactive visualization is crucial in understanding, exploring, and presenting data, but data scale can present serious barriers for effectiveness and adoption. I study these barriers and design solutions to remove them. My work ranges from theoretical to practical ; from designing solutions specifically for particular domains to designing general infrastructure for large-scale visualization. Since joining UA, I have worked in a number of projects here, including support for interactive browsing of synteny data at CoGe , and building up interactive visualization infrastructure at NOAO and the ANTARES project. If you're interested in our work, you should also take a look at the webpage of the HDC Lab which I cofounded with my colleagues, Josh Levine and Kate Isaacs . (I'm trying something different for writing , instead of a blog.) FUNDED PROJECTS My work is funded by a number of institutions, including the NSF, AT&T, and the Arizona Board of Regents.
