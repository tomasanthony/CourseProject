Mobirise Website Builder v4.8.8 HOME TEACHING RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS Mobirise Nosayba El-Sayed I am a new Lecture-Track Faculty in the Computer Science department at Emory University. Bio. Before joining Emory, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at MIT , working on joint projects with Qatar Computing Research Institute ( QCRI ) in the area ofdata-driven system optimization in modern datacenters. I worked with Dr. Daniel Sanchez at MIT and Dr. Xiaosong Ma at QCRI. Before that, I completed my PhD at the University of Toronto with Dr. Bianca Schroeder . My thesis focused on the analysis and design of reliable datacenters. I also interned at Amazon Web Services where I worked on the prediction of power-outages in Amazon's datacenters. Contact information available at Emory's CS Website . Teaching Activities Spring 2019: I will be teaching CS171 - Introduction to Computer Science II, Section 1 CS170 - Introduction to Computer Science I, Sections 1 & 2 Fall 2018: I currently teach CS171 - Introduction to Computer Science II . In a previous life (aka grad school), I taught Database Systems at the University of Toronto. Research Activities Large-scale systems, like supercomputers and cloud-computing datacenters, are quite challenging to manage ( trust me, I wrote a thesis about it ). I am generally interested in designing and implementing data-driven techniques that exploit the different kinds of logs generated in these systems to improve how they operate, while utilizing simple machine-learning techniques. See my research page for more details on past and current projects. I am currently looking for students who are interested in working on data-driven analysis of large systems in online shopping companies. See my research page for more details .
