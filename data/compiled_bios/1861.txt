 Frank Stajano , PhD ( filologo disneyano I used to run a comics podcast ) Professor of Security and Privacy Department of Computer {Science and Technology} (This new name encourages incorrect parsing. Read as "Department of the science and technology of computers", not as "Department of computer science (first topic) and of technology (second topic)".) Computer Laboratory , University of Cambridge Security Group and Digital Technology Group Head, Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research , University of Cambridge Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge kinit -r99d Hello and welcome to my home on the web! Highlights, in a nutshell. In this video I talk about entrepreneurship and commercialisation of research from the academic viewpoint . In this other one I introduce Pico , my project to replace passwords. If you prefer reading papers to watching videos, this highly cited one explains why replacing passwords is hard and this one gives insights on the psychology of scam victims , with lessons for security system designers. I founded a national ( Inter-ACE ) and an international ( Cambridge2Cambridge ) cyber security competition and ran them for three years, as a contribution towards raising a new generation of cyber-defenders ( Poster ). The international competition was a collaboration with MIT CSAIL . Please read this before mailing me, and this if you want to become my student. Maybe you're already at Cambridge and want to do your project with me ? Contact information is at the bottom of the page. Things I... | am | 've written | teach | like | don't like | am on the program committee of | keep on my web page | said My research interests revolve primarily around three interconnected themes: systems security privacy in the electronic society ubiquitous computing. I have a particular interest in the human aspects of systems security: many people like my 2009 work with Paul Wilson about understanding the psychology of scam victims to improve systems security. It was an invited talk at Usenix Security in August 2010 and an updated and abridged version of our technical report appeared in Communications of the ACM in March 2011 , ACM ( cached ). I presented this work in 4 continents: America (Cambridge MA, Pittsburgh PA, New York NY, Washington DC), Europe (London (twice), Athens, Cambridge (twice), Munich, Zurich, Bucarest), Oceania (Gold Coast) and Asia (Fujisawa). Lately, my research question has been: can we do better than passwords? In 2011 I wrote Pico: no more passwords! ( blog post , Forbes coverage) which then became an invited talk at Usenix Security 2011 in San Francisco, USA and the opening keynote talk at RTCSA 2011 in Toyama, Japan. I have since received generous funding from the European Research Council, in the form of a prestigious and competitive ERC Starting Grant , to pursue my research on Pico. While revising that work I then decided that the ever-growing "related work" section of Pico was worth its own study, so I invited three expert coauthors for the project that became The Quest to Replace Passwords: A Framework for Comparative Evaluation of Web Authentication Schemes , the highest-scoring peer-reviewed paper at Oakland 2012 (watch me give the talk in San Francisco on 2012-05-23). An extended version , with full details and ratings for over 30 password replacement schemes, is available as a tech report . In related threads, and with other coauthors, I also studied the security and privacy of forensic genomics and of social networking web sites such as Facebook . See the web page of my brilliant former graduate student Jonathan Anderson for more on privacy in social networks. Historically, my most significant research contributions include works on authentication in ad-hoc networks (the Resurrecting Duckling , with Ross Anderson , over 1700 citations on Google Scholar) , measuring, and protecting, location privacy in mobile computing environments (the Mix Zones, with Alastair Beresford , over 1700 citations ; see also later works with Alastair or Ford-Long Wong: 2004 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 ) , understanding how we might replace passwords (with Joseph Bonneau, Cormac Herley and Paul van Oorschot, over 500 citations ; see also mypico.org and the other papers there) I also enjoy coming up with quirky, eyebrow-raising uses of security protocols (sometimes with a serious aside), such as Multichannel protocols to prevent relay attacks without using distance bounding (2010, with Ford-Long Wong and Bruce Christianson); Cyberdice , i.e. online gambling, for money, in a context where everybody else may be cheating and colluding against you (2008, with Richard Clayton; see also the transcript of the lively discussion ); Romantic Cryptography , i.e. how to say "I love you" but only if the other person is going to say "me too" (2000, with William Harris); The Cocaine Auction Protocol , i.e. how to auction off some valuable goods in a context where all bidders want anonymity and there is definitely no trusted third party. (1999, with Ross Anderson.) I worked with civil engineers on the real-world security of wireless sensor networks to monitor the structural health of subway tunnels and suspension bridges . Other topics of interest include wireless technologies (efficient MAC protocols, 4G systems, Bluetooth security), context-aware software, distributed multimedia and so on: see further down for a full publications list . Although I now have a permanent faculty post at the University of Cambridge, I have a mixed academic and industrial background, having been employed by the R&D centres of major electronics, telecommunications and software multinationals (Google, Toshiba, AT&T, Oracle, Olivetti). Thanks to this, my research has always retained a strong practical orientation. Since my academic appointment I have continued to consult for industry in Europe and Asia on systems security, strategic research planning, creativity and innovation. I am the author of the well-regarded research monograph Security for Ubiquitous Computing (Wiley, 2002). I am a popular public speaker and I was called upon as invited or keynote speaker over 40 times on four continents (not counting the presentations of my refereed papers). I also served as program chair at 7 international conferences or workshops; as program committee member for over 30 events; as technical reviewer of book proposals for scientific publishers such as Wiley and Addison-Wesley; and as associate editor for an IEEE journal . I have authored or co-authored over 50 refereed publications , three book chapters, two patent applications, one book and I have edited two LNCS proceedings volumes. I was elected a Toshiba Fellow in 2000. I was appointed to a Lectureship at the University of Cambridge in 2000, originally at the Department of Engineering, then transferred to the Computer Laboratory in 2004. In 2006 I was awarded academic tenure until retiring age. In 2007 I was promoted to a University Senior Lectureship, in 2013 to a Readership and in 2017 to a Professorship. Before that, I had the privilege of doing a security PhD here at Cambridge under the supervision of Ross Anderson . I completed it in exactly three years: matriculated in January 1998, submitted in December 2000, approved with no corrections in January 2001. My PhD was nominated for the British Computer Society "distinguished dissertation" award and was later turned into the book mentioned above. The first few steps of my academic lineage are all at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and go back to its founder Sir Maurice Wilkes , who built the first stored-program computer in the world: Frank Stajano - Ross Anderson - Roger Needham - David Wheeler - Maurice Wilkes . These were all people I knew well on a personal basis. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project , my lineage then continues upwards to John Ratcliffe, Edward Appleton, JJ Thomson, John Strutt (Lord Rayleigh), Edward Routh, William Hopkins, Adam Sedgwick, Thomas Jones, Thomas Postlethwaite, Stephen Whisson, Walter Taylor, Robert Smith, Roger Cotes, Isaac Newton, Isaac Barrow, Vincenzo Viviani, Galileo Galilei, Ostilio Ricci, Nicol Tartaglia, with additional non-linear detours through such eminent figures as Rutherford and Torricelli among others. I have taught a variety of core computing subjects to engineers and computer scientists, including operating systems, computer architecture, security, data structures and algorithms, as well as more specialized subjects such as hardware design, FPGA programming, assembly language programming and ubiquitous computing. I greatly enjoy lecturing and helping other people reach "lightbulb moments". I love Japan! I lived in Japan for one year and I maintain strong ties to the Toshiba Corporate Research and Development Center in Kawasaki and Keio University. In my spare time I am a comics scholar with a particular interest in Disney material. I have coauthored a few books, book chapters and articles on this subject. Although not as frequently as I'd like, I offer audio interviews with comics authors on my comics podcast . I have a strong interest in kendo (Japanese swordsmanship). Since October 2002 I am the leader of Tsurugi Bashi, the kendo dojo of the University of Cambridge . I am 3rd dan and a BKA -licenced "regional coach" (meaning that I run courses to train and license other kendo instructors). I attended the gruelling one-week "Foreign Kendo Leaders" seminar in Kitamoto, Japan in July 2008. I haven't kept an exact count but by now a few hundred people have started kendo as my students. Over a dozen of them (Michael Gratzke*, Theo Rutter , Jake Barber , Adam Jackson*, Min Lin*, Daisy Chen*, Ivy Ko , Mikyung Jang*, Eng Tin Aw* , Matt Marley *, Periklis Akritidis , Eric Tung , Damien Vadillo ) now hold Dan grades and those with a star also hold BKA coach licences; several of them even started new dojo. Since I became dojo leader, Cambridge defeated Oxford seven times at the annual Varsity match, and also won first place at the 2009 British inter-university championship.

If you are browsing from *.cam.ac.uk, I'll let you download my Word file so you can use it too.

I'm pleased with the result, but Word is a big mess, especially when you have to edit the sideways text.

Things I keep on my web page ...and sometimes on my door; many items here are in the form of little A4 posters that you can print and attach to your own door too! Are you ready to become a parent ? (Sent to me by Dave Clarke ) A comparative study of world religions (or cached ) One of the most interesting word s in the English language (audio clip, 2:30, 158 KB). If restaurants functioned like Microsoft How hot is it in hell The history of electricity Windows 95: Independence Day (in Italian) How Easter Eggs are made How to hunt an elephant The netpbm man pages (227 pages, 425 kB) in a legible and easily printable format. This is not funny (sorry) but it's nevertheless damn useful. I was fed up with not being able to read the man pages from windows and so I did the conversion (groff, distiller etc) once and for all. Haiku error messages Frank's do-it-yourself kana cards Things I said (in theory I should wait to be dead before putting this up, but...) Websurfo, ergo sum The truly cool don't have backgrounds ...and even sillier things that enterprising students have seen fit to record for posterity. In fact, they have a whole database of quotes from lecturers in this department.

Don't, if you're a salesperson, or I may be rude to you. Time zone info: the UK uses the UTC+0 time zone and goes to UTC+1 during the summer (actually from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October); most other EU countries, instead, are on UTC+1 and UTC+2 respectively, but the change is synchronised, so the time difference with Central Europe is now always 1 hour (this used to be different). Japan is on UTC+9 and, in its wisdom, stays there all year long. Email These days, I get a lot of email. A long time ago I used to reply to almost every message. I soon stopped doing that, but for many years I kept on carefully reading every message. In the late 1990s I stopped doing that too, because of spam: initially it was a big shock for me to delete stuff without having read it ("what if it was important?"), but then I got over it. Nowadays I ask the Bayesian filter in Thunderbird (not as good as the wonderful Python-powered Spambayes , but more conveniently accessible) to throw away messages on my behalf without even showing them to me. The stuff that gets through I usually read, except if it's too long or if it contains Microsoft attachments. DON'T send me Microsoft attachments, which are notorious virus vehicles; ideally, if you want to be kind, please don't send me any attachments at all. Unless I already know you have a good reason for sending it to me, mail with attachments may be discarded unread, or actually not even downloaded from the server. I am happiest when people send me plain text or, at most, a pointer to a pdf. Even after all this filtering, I still get way too much mail. I write over 10 replies per workday (often many more), but course I can't hope to keep up with an influx that is an order of magnitude larger. As Joachim Posegga once wrote, "response time tends to be an exponential function of message length". If you want to write to me because you want to become my student at Cambridge, please read this helpful and instructive page . If you don't (and I will be able to tell from your message) I might just silently ignore you; or, if you're lucky, just point you again to this page . Having said all that, my email address is givenname.familyname@cst.cam.ac.uk. I use and encourage the use of PGP (or its free equivalent GPG , to which I even once contributed a minor bug fix). My PGP keys are on the keyservers. I prefer to receive encrypted mail messages as inline ascii-armoured text as opposed to attachments.
