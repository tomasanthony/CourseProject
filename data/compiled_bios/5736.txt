Fickas received the B.S. degree from Oregon State University in Math, the M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Irvine in 1983. From 1978 to 1983, Fickas worked at USC Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, California. In 1983, Fickas joined the faculty at Oregon. In 1988 he was awarded a Distinguished Visiting Researcher position at Cambridge University. In 1991 he was selected as a Fulbright Research Scholar to the Hungarian Academy of Science. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1996. Research Interests Professor Fickas has a general interest in software engineering. His recent focus has been on how software engineering concepts can be applied to non-tech domains, e.g., education, the humanities, urban planning. He has a particular interest in the means software engineering can support human-in-the-loop programming as practiced in data science. Beyond these specific interests, Professor Fickas retains a broad interest in the software engineering field; he was General Chair of both ICSE and RE, the flagship conferences in his fields of study.
