In my research, Im broadly interested in the intersection of computer graphics with artificial intelligence and machine learning: I build intelligent machines that understand the visual world and can help people be visually creative. This entails developing technologies that do things such as: Exploring a manifold of good designs Suggesting new (or unexpected ) design possibilities Synthesizing new designs from examples or large datasets Inferring structure from unstructured designs to facilitate editing Directing the output of stochastic generative processes Much of my group's current work focuses on analyzing, modeling, and synthesizing 3D scenes and the objects that comprise them. I received my PhD from Stanford University , where I worked with Pat Hanrahan in the Graphics Lab and with Noah Goodman in the Computation and Cognition Lab . I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley . News January 2019 I'm co-organizing a workshop on 3D Scene Generation at CVPR 2019. December 2018 Yunchao Liu's work on inferring scene-generating programs from images accepted to ICLR 2019. September 2018 Kevin Ellis's work on visual program induction from hand-drawn graph sketches accepted as a spotlight presentation at NeurIPS 2018. August 2018 Aaron Gokaslan and Vivek Ramanujan's work on unsupervised image translation with large shape deformation to be presented at ECCV 2018. March 2018 New paper on deep convolutional scene synthesis models accepted to SIGGRAPH 2018.
