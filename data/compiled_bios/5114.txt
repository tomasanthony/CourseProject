Montella graduated in 2009 from Carnegie Mellon University with dual B.S. degrees in Physics and Business Administration. He began graduate studies at Lehigh University in 2010 under the direction of Prof. John Spletzer, where he worked on projects such as an autonomous wheelchair and an autonomous gliding aircraft that extracts energy from the wind to fly perpetually. In 2015, Corey took a hiatus from graduate studies to work in industry on a programming language called Eve , a greenfield look at programming as a practice that drew inspiration from such languages as Datalog and Smalltalk. In 2018, he returned to Lehigh to complete and defend his dissertation, titled An End-to-End Platform for Autonomous Dynamic Soaring in Wind Shear. Corey is currently working on Mech , a programming language for developing data-driven, reactive systems like animations, games, and robots.
