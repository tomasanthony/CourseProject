Chitta Baral Professor Chitta Baralhas been at ASU since 1999.Barals main research interests are threefold: (i) developing language constructs and surrounding building block results for representing knowledge and reasoning with it, (ii) developing a theory of actions and their impact on an environment and using it in autonomous agent design, planning and diagnosis, (iii) Using (i) and (ii) in modeling cell behavior and reasoning with it to explain observations and develop plans of action so as to alter pathways that could suggest therapeutic procedures. chitta@asu.edu 480-727-6047 BYENG 572 http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/ Education Ph.D., University of Maryland, 1991 Master of Science Computer Science, University of Maryland, 1990 Bachelor of Technology with Honors Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, 1987 Research interests Knowledge representation, temporal logics, logic programming, dynamic systems, text extraction, question answering, natural language semantics, bioinformatics Honors and awards  NSF CAREER Award, 1995 Member, senior program committee, AAAI 2002 and 2004 Best paper awards at CoopIS 2000 and ATAL 1999 Team adviser of robot teams that placed 1st (1997) and 3rd (1996) in AAAI robot contests  Key activities  Associate Editor of Journal of AI Research Area Editor of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic Editorial Board Member of Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming   January 7, 2016 CIDSE         Chitta Baral   Professor  Department of Computer Science and Engineering   Ira A.
