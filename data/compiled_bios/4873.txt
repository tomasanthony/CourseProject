I am interested in examining how language change informs our understanding of phonology and morphology. My research interests include: the phonology of stress systems (and especially morphologically governed stress systems);nominal categorization, including noun classifier, noun class and gender systems, and the computational modeling of these systems;the phonology of poetic meter and rhyme; andthe linguistics of ancient and modern law.I am also interested in the historical grammar of the various Indo-European branches, the Mayan languages, and the languages of the Caucasus. Much of my work has focused on the older Indo-European languages, the Native American languages of the Pacific Northwest, and the languages of the Caucasus.
