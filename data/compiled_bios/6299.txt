Eng.-University of Genova 2001 Laurea Degree Elect. Eng.-University of Genova Short Bio I received my Laurea degree and Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the University of Genoa, Italy, in 2001 and 2005 respectively. In 2005 I was Adjunct Professor at the University of Salento, Lecce, Italy. I held research associate positions at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Lige, Belgium (2005-2007) and at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University (2007-2009). From 2009 to 2011 I was an assistant professor at the Technische Universitt Mnchen (TUM), Munich, Germany. I am presently an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. I am a member of the editorial board of the Control Systems Society and an associate editor for the journal Systems and Control Letters. Research Interests Dynamical systems with special emphasis in the analysis and control of complex interconnected systems. More specifically my research currently focuses on developing principles and methodologies in systems and control theory to analyze and control emergent dynamics in biological and engineered systems.
