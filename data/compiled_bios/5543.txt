My research draws on insights from differential geometry and computer science to develop fundamental algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and my PhD from the California Institute of Technology. My most recent work was supported by an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship at Columbia University.
