 Florian Shkurti Assistant Professor, Computer Science Mathematical and Computational Sciences, University of Toronto, Mississauga Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto My research is at the intersection of mobile robotics, computer vision, machine learning, planning and control. My goal is to enable robots to efficiently learn how to perform reliably in outdoor environments and alongside humans, without supervision, by watching unstructured visual demonstrations. When human supervision and human-robot interaction are necessary, I want to enable people to effectively specify the desired behavior of their robots through as few interactive demonstrations as possible, without requiring them to write code. I am particularly interested in: Robust imitation learning from visual data Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning of cost functions Planning and control under cost function and model uncertainty, as well as partial observability Learning visual attention operators for robot exploration, navigation, and search Shared autonomy and safe control for human-robot collaboration Active semi-supervised learning for visual data Perception and semantic video understanding Field robotics and deployment in outdoor environments The main applications of my research so far have been in environmental monitoring by robots that autonomously operate outdoors and collect useful data for environmental scientists. In these outdoor domains human-robot collaboration, learning from a few demonstrations, and robust navigation in 3D are critical. I have also worked on vision-based simultaneous mapping, localization , and navigation for ground, aerial, and underwater robots . I was a member of the McGill Mobile Robotics Lab and the NSERC Canadian Field Robotics Network . I am looking for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students to join my research group. You should apply to CS . I'm also interested in working with students with backgrounds in ECE and MIE. Feel free to send me an email with your CV, transcript, and research interests.
