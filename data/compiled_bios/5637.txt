Cheng Chang LuMy research focuses on developing theories, algorithms and software in areas of image segmentation, medical imaging and biological imaging. In image segmentation, powerful tools have been built to find and extract regions of interest in images and to obtain unique descriptions for a variety of input images. In medical imaging, efficient registration methods have been developed for images with various modalities. In biological imaging, efficient segmentation algorithms based on cluster computing environment have been developed to process confocal and electron microscopic images automatically. Recently, I have been working with researchers in Education Technology in developing mobile STEM learning environment.Job TitleProfessor, Assistant Chair, and Graduate AdvisorJob DepartmentComputer ScienceCampusKentEmailclu@kent.eduPhone330-672-9031Fax330-672-0737Personal WebsiteWebsite
