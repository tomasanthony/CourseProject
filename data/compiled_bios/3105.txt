 Sara "Scout" Sinclair Contact | Teaching | Research | What to call me I am a Lecturer in the Computer Science Department at Swarthmore College. Prior to joining Swarthmore, I was the founding Executive Director of Simply Secure . I also worked at Google as a Product Manager (starting in the Associate Product Manager program) on projects in security, Android, and human-rights technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Security from Dartmouth College with Access Control In and For the Real World . Contact My email address is scout (at) swarthmore [dot] edu. My office is Science Center 262A. My office hours for Spring 2019 are Thursdays 11:15-12:15, Fridays 3:00-4:00, and by appointment. Teaching In S19 I am teaching lab sections of CS 21 and CS 31. Research My primary research interests are in computer security, human factors, and their intersection ("usable security"). I am also interested in the use of technology to support advocacy and activism for human rights, ethics in technology, how large organizations effect change, and socio-technical systems more broadly. As a human-factors researcher my orientation is primarily qualitative. Google Scholar has a reasonably complete record of my publications. What to call me I usually go by "Scout", which is a nickname given to me in honor of the book To Kill A Mockingbird . If you are more comfortable using titles, you can call me "Dr. Scout" (my preferred honorific) or "Professor Sinclair". "Sara" is a very common name and if you use it I am likely to assume you're talking to someone else. My married name is Brody (my husband is also in the Computer Science Department at Swarthmore). In various places I may also be referred to as "Sara Brody", "Scout Brody", or "Sara 'Scout' Sinclair Brody".
