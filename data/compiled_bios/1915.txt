Gregory Valiant >main >papers >teaching >code >contact I am an Assistant Professor in Stanford's Computer Science Department. Some of my recent projects focus on designing algorithms for accurately inferring information about complex distributions, when given surprisingly little data. More broadly, my research interests are in algorithms, learning, applied probability, and statistics, and evolution. Prior to joining Stanford, I was a postdoc at Microsoft Research, New England, and received my PhD from Berkeley in Computer Science, and BA in Math from Harvard. My office is 470 Gates. NEW: The Stanford Theory Group is currently accepting applications for the inaugural Motwani Postdoctoral Fellowship. For further information and to apply, please see this link. I am extremely lucky to advise the following students: Weihao Kong Vatsal Sharan Hongyang Zhang (coadvised with Ashish Goel) Melody Guan Shivam Garg Brian Axelrod (coadvised with Omer Reingold) Annie Marsden (coadvised with John Duchi) Neha Gupta (coadvised with Moses Charikar) Kai Sheng Tai (coadvised with Peter Bailis)
