Kirstin Hagelskjaer Petersen Assistant Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering kirstin@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Natural swarms, such as ants, bees, and termites, exhibit sophisticated colony level behaviors with remarkably scalable and error tolerant properties. Their evolutionary success stems from more than just intelligent individuals, it hinges on their morphology, their physical interactions, and the way they shape and leverage their environment. Petersen'sresearch explores how the same principles can be leveragedto achieve advanced autonomy in robot collectives, through hardware and software co-development, and by integrating the shared environment into the design process. Currentresearch themes span collective robotic construction, human swarm interaction,soft robot collectives, biological swarms, and bio-hybrid collectives. Kirstin did her postdoctoral work with Director Sitti at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems 2014-2016 and became a fellow with the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems in 2015. Her thesis was completed in 2014 with Professor Nagpal at Harvard University and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.She completed a masters in Computer Systems Engineering with Professor Hallam at the University of Southern Denmark in2008, and a bachelor in electro-technical engineering with Odense University College of Engineering in2005..
