 Jan-Michael Frahm is an Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He received his Ph.D in computer vision in 2005 from the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Germany. His dissertation, Camera Self-Calibration with Known Camera Orientation received the prize for that years best Ph.D. dissertation in CAUs College ofEngineering.His Diploma in Computer Science is from the University ofLbeck. Dr. Frahms research interests include a variety of computer vision problems. He has worked on structure from motion for single/multi-camera systems for static and dynamic scenes to create 3D models of the scene; real-time multi-view stereo to create a dense scene geometry from camera images; use of camera-sensor systems for 3D scene reconstruction with fusion of multiple orthogonal sensors; improved robust and fast estimation methods from noisy data to compensate for highly noisy measurements in various stages of the reconstruction process; high performance feature tracking for salient image-point motion extraction; and the development of data-parallel algorithms for commodity graphics hardware for efficient 3D reconstruction. Dr. Frahm has worked at UNC in the real-time urban modeling project UrbanScape and received the Best Demo Award for it at CVPR 2007. He has written more than 100 peer-reviewed and invited publications.
