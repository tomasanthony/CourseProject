Clare Nguyen FULL-TIME FACULTY -  Welcome I am an instructor in the Computer Information Systems (CIS) Department. I teach online and hybrid classes at De Anza College. On the left side are the classes that I teach in the current quarter as well as an overview of my tentative classes in the next quarters. The best way to contact me is through email, but if you're already on campus, feel free to drop by during office hour this quarter. Some campus views I get to enjoy every day (Photos courtesy of De Anza College)
