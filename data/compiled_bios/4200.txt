The goal of Stephanie's research is to enhance the reliability, maintainability, and security of software systems through statically-typed programming languages. Her research explores novel methods to bring more expressive type systems to users. Stephanie works to reconcile the features of expressive-but-theoretical type systems with existing languages, while partially automating the process of type system design to improve confidence in the soundness of more complicated type systems. Stephanie is also engaged in incorporating programming logics into the design of practical type systems so that application-specific properties may be expressed.
