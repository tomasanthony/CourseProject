Funded Proposals 2017/04: SERB early career research (ECR) award, title: Secure and Reliable Non-volatile Memories for Ultra-low Power Applications 2018/08: SRC USA, title: Designing efficient hardware-accelerators for Autonomous Driving Vehicles Open-source software released 1. DESTINY : DESTINY is an acronym for 3 D d e sign- s pace explora ti on tool for SRAM, eDRAM and n on-volatile memor y . DESTINY can model: * (2D/3D) SRAM and eDRAM * (2D/3D, SLC/MLC) STT-RAM, ReRAM and PCM * (2D, SLC/MLC) SOT-RAM, Flash, DWM In its purpose, DESTINY is similar to CACTI, CACTI-3DD or NVSim. Here are manual and the JLPEA 2017 journal paper . Source-code is available here . See its news coverage on ReRAM forum . Join DESTINY mailing list or see archive of previous conversations . The proverb goes, write your own destiny . Hence, we have written our own [tool named] DESTINY . J 2. Both serial and parallel versions of code of red-black SOR (successive over-relaxation) method in three state-of-the-art languages, viz. Chapel (from Cray Inc.), D (also called dlang, from Digital Mars) and Go (also called golang, from Google) can be downloaded for academic use from this link . They were used in this paper. Chapel version of the code has been incorporated in Chapel performance test suite/examples.
