With respect to computer security he is working on techniques to detect malicious code (viruses, worms, time bombs, etc.) in programs and to detect attempts to penetrate or misuse computer systems, especially computer networks. With respect to verification, he is applying an automated theorem prover (Higher Order Logic HOL) to the verification of hardware and software systems, especially operating systems for safety-critical embedded systems. With respect to software engineering, he is working on new methods for testing programs that make use of heuristic techniques and methods for automating the generation of operating system code from templates.
