As of January 2017 I am a lecturer in computer science at Boston University. I also serve as the Undergraduate Program Director.I am interested in algorithmically challenging problems. I have been working on questions in data mining and combinatorial optimization. Many of the problems I am working on are defined on networks or can be modeled by one. I was a postdoctoral research associate in theRaphael Labat Brown University under the supervision of Ben Raphael. I completed my PhD as a member of theData Management Labat Boston University. I was so fortunate to haveEvimaria Terzias my advisor. I received my MSc degree in pure mathematics from Eotvos University under the supervision ofAndras Frank.
