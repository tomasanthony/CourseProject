 Students Alumni Research Teaching Vacancies Contact My name is Gabriel Brostow, and I am a professor in Computer Science here at UCL . My group explores research problems relating to Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. The students and colleagues here have diverse interests, but my focus is on "Human in the Loop Computer Vision," for analysis and synthesis applications. To me, this means having or finding satisfying answers to these questions about a system, whether interactive or fully automated: I) Does the system know the intended purpose of the data being captured? II) Can the system assess its own accuracy? III) Does the system ask questions of users, when it's uncertain? I love this field because it allows us to apply our expertise to a variety of tough problems, including film and photo special effects (computational photography), action analysis (of people, animals, and cells), and authoring systems (for architecture, animation, presentations) that make the most of user effort. "Motion reveals everything" used to be my main research mantra, but that has now taken hold sufficiently (obviously NOT just through my efforts!) that it no longer needs championing. Previously, I had a visiting researcher appointment at ETH Zurich 's CVG Group , and a Marshall Sherfield Fellowship in the Computer Vision & Robotics Group at Cambridge University. I did my PhD with Irfan Essa at Georgia Tech , and my undergraduate degree at UT Austin . News: See my group's YouTube Channel . (June 2017) Our work on detecting bats in the Olympic Park hit the press today! See the BBC article on the front of their Science section, or the front-page of UCL's site. Some behind-the-scenes context: The real machine learning R&D was done by Daniyar Turmukhambetov, Oisin Mac Aodha, and Michael Firman. All are current/recent postdocs from our group. Most started as MSc students here! Sarah Gallacher is the linchpin of the project. Not surprising, as she started with a background in software engineering and machine learning, and then got into HCI. There are many other people involved, and you should read about them and see the project landing page: https://naturesmartcities.com/. I'll just add that Libby Kinsey did her MSc a few years ago in our group, working with Oisin and Kate Jones, to get the initial bat-call detector working on full-size computers. So what you're seeing running in the Olympic Park is the result of these people's hard work to build ML models, herd volunteers, gather data, build hardware, shrink ML models, waterproof prototypes, etc. That's several people's very hard work over a sustained period of time! Thanks to EPSRC EP/K015664/1 and EP/K503745/1 for co-funding this work. Collecting some of the press coverage here: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/headlines/0617/290617-shazam-for-bats To see the bats ping'ing, check out the live map (best at night): http://batslondon.com . (Mar-Sep 2017) I am Program Co-Chair for BMVC 2017 . Come to the conference in September! We had a record number of submissions, as this is a top venue for publishing new work in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. (May 2017) Our handwriting-synthesis project has passed 50k views on YouTube. (Oct 2016) I'll be an Area Chair for CVPR 2017 - the top ranked Computer Science publication. (July 2016) I have joined IEEE TPAMI as an Associate Editor. Submit your great papers, so they can appear in the top-ranked journal in all of Computer Science! (Sep 2016) We have filed for a patent on our MonoDepth work!
