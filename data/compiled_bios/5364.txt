 I'm Christophe Dubach, a Reader (Associate Professor) at the University of Edinburgh. I'm part of the CArD group in the school of informatics. My research interests include data-prallel language design and implementation, high-level code generation and optimisation for parallel hardware (e.g. GPU, FPGAs), architecture design space exploration, and the use of machine-learning techniques applied to all these topics. News PhD studentships available for UK/European students through the EPSRC Center for Doctoral Training in Pervasive Parallelism.

These parallel systems exhibit tremendous computational power at the cost of increased programming effort. This results in a tension between performance and code portability. This project investigates a novel approach aiming to combine high-level programming, code portability, and high-performance. Starting from a high-level functional expression we apply a simple set of rewrite rules to transform it into a low-level functional representation close to the OpenCL programming model and from which OpenCL code is generated. Our rewrite rules define a space of possible implementations which we automatically explore to generate hardware-specific OpenCL implementations. GPU-Acceleration for the Graal VM Project supported by . Michel Steuwer Juan Fumero Toomas Remmelg This project aims at automatically accelerating applications running on top of the Graal VM , an Open source Java VM. To achieve this goal we first define a high-level API inspired by functional programming and data-flow programming concepts. At runtime, our system recognises the calls to our API and automatically generate OpenCL kernels. The runtime then manages the execution of this OpenCL kernel on multiple devices (e.g. GPU) which results in the application being transparently accelerated. Design Space Exploration for Dynamically Reconfigurable Multicore Project supported by . Paul Micolet Dynamical reconfigurable multicore processors, such as the E2 architecture , offer the ability to merge simple cores into larger ones in order to increase performance. However, the problem of deciding how to aggregate these cores is non-trivial and is highly dependent on the application. In this project, we investigate the problem of mapping multi-threaded applications written in a data-flow language to this type of architecture. Design Space Exploration for Heterogeneous Multicore Project supported by . Erik Tomusk Single-ISA heterogeneous processors have the potential to maximise performance in power-constrained mobile devices by running each job on the best available CPU core given a power budget. This research project focuses on developing new techniques to select the best set of cores in order to maximise runtime flexibility in terms of power and performance. GPU Optimisation & Machine-Learning Project supported by . Alberto Magni Programming models such as OpenCL have been designed to achieve functional portability across multi-core devices from different vendors. However, the lack of a single cross-target optimizing compiler severely limits performance portability of OpenCL programs. Programmers need to manually tune applications for each specific device, preventing effective portability. In this project, we target a compiler transformations specific for data-parallel languages such as thread-coarsening. We address the problem of finding the best parameters that control these transformation in order to reach maximum performance. We propose a solution based on a machine-learning model that predicts the best optimisation parameters using static code features. The model automatically specializes to the different architectures considered.
