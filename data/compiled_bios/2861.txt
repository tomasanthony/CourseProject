Cheriton School	of Computer Science	University of	Waterloo	Senior Fellow, Canadian Institute for	Advanced Research	Member, Institute for Quantum	Computing	Affiliate Member,	Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics	Research	My research focuses on the theory of quantum information and its	applications to algorithms, complexity theory, and cryptography.	Specific topics that I am currently interested in include quantum	interactive proof systems, quantum information theory, and the	theory of entanglement.	I am also interested in algorithms, complexity theory, and	theoretical computer science more generally.
