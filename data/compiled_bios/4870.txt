As Professor of the Practice at Brandeis University I teach Software Entrepreneurship, Software Engineering, Software Design and Robotics. The thread running through this is "Applied Computer Science". I believe strongly that our students need to learn and become aware of how they can have a real impact on the world, in my case, by applying their Computer Science education. As a result, I invest a lot of time and energy to provide experiential experiences outside the classroom, team experiences as part of courses, and in general a connection to the outside world. My own interests are in Software Engineering of Large Systems, Open Source Software, new and innovative Computer Programming languages. Before teaching I worked in a variety of roles in the Software Industry. I was the co-founder and former Chief Technology officer of eRoom Technology, Inc, an early an internet-based project collaboration application. While working at Lotus Development I was responsible for the work that led to Lotus Improv, credited by some with being the first appearance of the so-called "Pivot Table". Further, with my own firm, I have consulted to technology companies and developing new products.
