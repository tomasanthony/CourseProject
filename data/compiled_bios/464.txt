Elmore is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and the College of the University of Chicago. Aaron was previously a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT  working with Mike Stonebraker on elastic and multitenant database systems, and Sam Madden on the DataHub project. Aaron\'s thesis on Elasticity Primitives for Database-as-a-Service was completed at the University of California, Santa Barbara under the supervision of Divy Agrawal and Amr El Abbadi. Prior to receiving a PhD, Aaron spent several years in industry and completed an MS at the University of Chicago. His research interests include elastic systems, database multitenancy, live data migration, cloud computing, and making data management easier for other scientific domains. Prospective Students:   I am unavailable to comment on any                 applications, but if you are interested in pursuing a PhD in data management, or systems research in general, I strongly encourage you to apply to UChicago.                 The department is rapidly growing in systems and has a strong presence in                 theory and machine learning.  News: I will be speaking at SIAM and DeMist July 2017 on collaborative analytics and elastic databases respectively. Database research at UChicago is growing! Mike Franklin is joining UChicago as chair! I will be co-chair with Alvin Cheung for the SIGMOD 2017 Student Research Competition.                  Alvin Cheung and I are also co-chairs for VLDB 2017 Proceedings. I will be co-chair for SIGMOD 2016 Demonstrations Track.                 On April 30th I will be hosting an ACM webinar with Turing award winner Mike Stonebraker.                 Register                 Here
