Current Projects Wrasse: Riding Millimetre Radio Waves at Gigabit-per-second Speeds This project seeks to explore the potential of wireless networks operating in the 60GHz frequency-band to achieve Gb/s data-rates. The problems we are currently investigating include 802.11ad performance analysis, resource allocation, and small cell backhauling. The research is partially funded by the University of Edinburgh Development Trust through an Innovative Initiative Grant. Past Projects FLAVIA: FLexible Architecture for Virtualizable future wireless Internet Access (20112013) FLAVIA is a successfully completed collaborative research project funded by the European Commission through a FP7-2009-ICT-5 grant. The team focused on exposing flexible programmable interfaces for commercial off-the-shelf wireless devices, that enable service customisation and performance optimisation through software-based exploitation of low-level operations and control primitives. CARMEN: CARrier grade MEsh Networks (20082010) CARMEN is a successfully completed collaborative research project funded by the European Commission through a FP7-2008-ICT-1 grant. The objective was to designed a heterogeneous wireless mesh network architecture supporting carrier grade triple-play services for mobile/fixed network operators. DAIDALOS II: Designing Advanced network Interfaces for the Delivery and Administration of Location independent, Optimised personal Services (20072008) DAIDALOS II is a successfully completed integrated project funded by the European Commission through a FP6-2004-IST-4 grant. The project designed, developed and validateed a beyond 3 rd generation mobile communications framework, supporting secure, personalised and pervasive services built on heterogeneous technology.
