Ananth Grama Samuel D. Conte Professor of Computer Science Joined department: 1996 EducationBE, University of Roorkee, Computer Science and Technology (1989) MS, Wayne State University, Computer Engineering (1990) PhD, University of Minnesota, Computer Science (1996) Professor Grama's research interests span the areas of parallel and distributed computing architectures, algorithms, and applications. His work on distributed infrastructure deals with development of software support for dynamic clustered and multiclustered environments. More recent work has focused on resource location and allocation mechanisms in peer-to-peer networks. His research on applications has focused on particle dynamics methods, their applications to dense linear system solvers, and fast algorithms for data compression and analysis. Professor Grama has authored several papers and co-authored a text book Introduction to Parallel Computing: Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Vipin Kumar, Anshul Gupta, and George Karypis. He is a member of American Association for Advancement of Sciences and Sigma Xi.
