Joohyung Lee Associate Professor Joohyung Lee has been at ASU since 2005.His current research and teaching interests are in logic-based Artificial Intelligence. He works on knowledge representation and reasoning (studying how to encode knowledge into computers and let computers do reasoning like humans based on the encoded knowledge), logic programming (how to use logic directly as a programming language), common-sense reasoning (how to endow commonsense to computers) and declarative programming methods (programming focusing on what is to be computed, rather than how to compute it). joolee@asu.edu 480-965-2784 BYENG 586 Education B.S.E., Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, 1998 Ph.D., Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin, 2005 Research interests Knowledge representation and reasoning, computational logic, logic programming, logics in security, computational semantics of natural language Honors and Awards AAAI 2004 Outstanding Paper Honorable Mention Award Key Activities  Co-chair of ASPOCP 2008, 2009 AAAI  2010 KR 2010 JELIA 2010 NMR 2010 Nonmon@30 IJCAI 2009 LPNMR 2009 Commonsense 2009 AAAI 2008 NMR 2008   February 23, 2015 CIDSE                      Sign In / Sign Out    Sign In     Menu    ASU Home  My ASU   Colleges & Schools   Arts and Sciences  Business  Design and the Arts  Education  Engineering  Future of Innovation in Society  Graduate  Health Solutions  Honors  Journalism  Law  Nursing and Health  Public Service and Community Solutions  Sustainability  University College  Thunderbird School of Global Management     Map & Locations   Map  Tempe  West  Polytechnic  Downtown Phoenix  Online and Extended  Lake Havasu  Skysong  Research Park  Washington D.C.
