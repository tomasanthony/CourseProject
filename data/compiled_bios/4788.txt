 Nate Foster Associate Professor Department of Computer Science Cornell University Office: 432 Gates Hall Phone: (607) 255-5210 Email: jnfoster[at]cs.cornell.edu Home Biography Publications Overview My research uses ideas from programming languages to solve problems in networking, databases, and security. Some topics of interest include semantics, type systems, bidirectional languages, data synchronization, and mechanized proof. Recently I spend most of my time thinking about network programming .
