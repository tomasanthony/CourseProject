Before joining UCL in 2007, I completed a PhD in Psychology at Cardiff University followed by a post-doc in Computer Science at Drexel University . While a PhD student I interned at PARC and Mircrosoft Research . Research My research is in the field of Human-Computer Interaction and is concerned with understanding how people manage digital distractions, focusing on four main themes: (1) technology use in the car, (2) managing interruptions in the workplace, (3) using devices in the home, (4) visual search of screens. I've published over 75 research articles (see Google Scholar ). Support has come from grants provided by the EPSRC , H2020 , and EIT Digital . Teaching I'm the director of the HCI MSc programme at UCL . I'm the module convenor for PSYC0101 Interaction Science . I'm External Examiner for the BSc Applied Psychology programme at the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology , Ireland. External Activities I'm Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Human-Computer Studies . I've served as Papers Subcommittee Chair at CHI 2019 and CHI 2018 . I'm a member of the EPSRC Peer Review College .
