 Vijay Chidambaram Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin Office: GDC 6.436, 2317 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 Email: vijayc@utexas.edu Twitter: @vj_chidambaram CV Calendar I lead the UT Systems and Storage Lab . I am also a part of the LASR research group. Research . My group aims to build the next generation of storage systems. This means building storage systems that have higher performance and stronger reliability. We build both storage systems and the tools need to develop such systems rigorously, such as testing frameworks. Our work involves innovation both at the data-structure level and at the systems level. We open-source all the software we build, and aim to have impact both inside academia and in industry. Recent major projects : Crashmonkey and Ace . Tools to systematically test file-system crash consistency. OSDI 2018 Star PebblesDB . Write-optimized key-value store that outperforms LevelDB and RocksDB. SOSP 2017 Star Current projects : Testing reliability of storage systems ( Jayashree Mohan ) Scaling blockchain ( Soujanya Ponnapalli and Aashaka Shah ) Improving performance of persistent-memory applications and file systems ( Rohan Kadekodi and Sekwon Lee ) Recent impact : Crashmonkey-generated tests have been added to xfstests, the file-system test suite for the Linux kernel ( msg , patch ) Crashmonkey found 10 long-standing bugs in btrfs and F2FS in the Linux kernel. Crashmonkey found a bug in the FSCQ verified file system which caused the file system to not persist data on fdatasync. The bug was in the unverified part of the file system (Haskell-C bindings). The techniques behind PebblesDB are being used in the storage product of a major IT company. If you are a student considering grad school or applying for grad school, these links may be useful (advice on contacting profs, getting letters of recommendation, etc.) I maintain the SOSP/OSDI Hall of Fame . This page indicates who has published the most at these premier venues, and who has been publishing recently. These are good guides for grad students trying to decide which professor to work with! My research is supported by NSF , VMware , Facebook , and Google . I am an Affiliated Researcher at VMware Research.
