 Huijia Lin Huijia (Rachel) Lin Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science , UCSB Harold Frank Hall 1153 Santa Barbara, CA, 93106 Email: rachel.lin at cs dot ucsb dot edu I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. From 2011 to 2013, I was a post-doctoral researcher at CSAIL MIT and the Computer Science department of Boston University , working with Shafi Goldwasser and Ran Canetti . I completed my PhD in 2011 at Cornell University with Rafael Pass as advisor. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Zhejiang University , China. News! Starting from Jan 2019, I will be an Associate Professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering , at University of Washington , Seattle. To new students, if you are interested in working with me, please apply to the PhD program there. Research Interests My research interests are in Cryptography, and its interplay with other areas in computer science, such as, complexity theory, algorithm design, and security.
