My research interests are in algorithms, machine learning and computational biology. Specifically, my work is focused on the design and analysis of algorithmswith guarantees on running time and solution quality that are motivated by, and are necessary for, problems in computational biology.Applications of my workinclude protein structure prediction and determination, protein-protein interactions, compound screening, as well as problems in high-throughput sequencing andproteomics.
