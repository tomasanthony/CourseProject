 Christopher W. Fletcher About Research Students Teaching Misc In Brief Christopher Wardlaw Fletcher Email: cwfletch [at] illinois [dot] edu , chris [dot] w [dot] fletcher [at] gmail [dot] com Hi there! My name is Chris Fletcher (a.k.a. 'Fletch', 'C Fletch', 'C F'). I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois--Urbana Champaign (CS Department). I grew up in Southern California and moved to Berkeley in 2006 to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I graduated with a Ph.D. (also in EECS) at MIT in 2016, and spent a year (Fall 2016-17) as a Research Post-doc at Nvidia. I am looking for PhD students! Please drop me a line to discuss any specific ideas you have for collaboration in computer architecture, security or deep learning (I especially enjoy working on projects that cover a subset of these). UIUC@CS is a top-5 department, don't forget to apply in December! Contact information If you would like to get into contact with me, start with email - I check it most frequently. Other outlets: github All of my accounts have a different iguana avatar. Iguanas look something like this:
