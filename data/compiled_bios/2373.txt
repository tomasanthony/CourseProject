I am Director of the Surrey Centre for Cyber Security, which is recognised by GCHQas one of the UK's Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research.I am also Associate Dean for Research and Enterprise in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, having taken the role on in January 2015.I joined the Department of Computer Science in September 2004 and was Head of Department 2004-2010. I was previouslyin the Department of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London over the period 1994-2004. I gained my doctorate from theUniversity of Oxford, and held post-doctoral positions there prior to joining Royal Holloway.30.01.19Read more16.04.18Read more10.04.18Read more05.05.17Read more03.04.17Read more05.07.16Read more04.05.16Read more15.12.15Read more04.09.15Read moreI have been working in the area of Secure Electronic Votingsince 2004. Since then I have been involved in the design and development of the Prt  Voter verifiable voting system including its implementation for use in the vVote system used in the 2014 State Election in the State of Victoria, Australia. I am interested in more general approachesto secure electronic voting, and the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies in this domain, and more generally.I am also researching in security and privacy in the transportation domain. InRail, we are focusing on the challenges around customer data privacy in the context of increased use of customer information to support journeys. Other work in rail has focused on the application of formal modelling approaches to establishing safety requirements within rail networks.In theAutomotivedomain we are focusing on security within vehicle-to-vehicle communications,These interests are grounded in earlier work in formal methods and in security around modelling and verification of security protocols, and in non-interference. In particular this has focused on methods for analysis of protocols between agents interacting in an insecure environment, and proving that they provide critical authentication and confidentiality properties.My formal methods work originated in concurrency theory, specifically the process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), and its timed version Timed CSP. I also work with the B-Method and with Event-B, their relationship to CSP, and their application to safety and security verification.I workwith Helen Treharne and collaborators in Swansea on developing new methods and tools for formally verifying safety for railway track plans.I am interested in scalability of the methods, enabling them to manage the complexity of real track plans.I have a longstanding collaboration with Peter Ryan of the University of Luxembourg and Vanessa Teague of the University of Melbourne in the area of Secure Electronic Voting.My work on secure electronic voting has led to the development of a verifiable voting system used in the November 2014 State election in the State of Victoria, Australia.I lead the final year undergraduate moduleComputer Security, and I supervise undergraduateand MSc projects.Google Scholar CitationsThe B-Method: an Introduction, Steve Schneider, S.APalgrave Cornerstones in Computer Science.
