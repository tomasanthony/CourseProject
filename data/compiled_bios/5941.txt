She was a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where she won a L'Oral For Women in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship. She has co-authored more than seventy-five journal articles, three book chapters, and three US Patents. Research SummaryMy research interest is nanophotonics, the study of how light interacts with nano- and microscale structures. My group studies nanophotonic structures such as photonic crystals, microresonators, and nanowires for applications in optical communications, energy, and biology. We use both theoretical and experimental techniques to study the basic science of nanophotonic materials, design novel devices, and optimize them for various applications.Awards2012 USC Viterbi School Junior Research Award2010 The White House Office of Science Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers2010 MIT Technology Review MIT TR35 Award2009 Army Research Office Army Research Office Young Investigator Award2009 National Science Foundation NSF CAREER Award2009 USC Powell Faculty Award2008 University of Southern California WISE Jr. Gabilan Chair2006 L'Oreal L'Oreal for Women in Science Fellowship1998 Lucent Technologies Lucent Technologies GRPW Fellowship1998 Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Karl Taylor Compton Fellowship1998 National Science Foundation NSF Graduate Fellowship1998  Phi Beta Kappa1998  Sigma Xi1997 Churchill Foundation Churchill Fellowship1997 University of Chicago Student Marshal1993 University of Chicago College Honor Scholarship1993 National Merit Foundation National Merit Scholarship1993 The White House Presidential Scholar1993 United States Department of Education Robert Byrd ScholarshipAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - ElectrophysicsPhysics and Astronomy OfficePHE 614Charles Lee Powell Hall3737 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 271 Contact Information(213) 740-8682povinell@usc.eduWebsitesResearch WebsitePublications"]
