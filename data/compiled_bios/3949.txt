 Yoon Lab - Home Contact us at: Home People Research Publications Fun Welcome to Yo on Lab Our group focuses on creating self-contained microsystems that combine and process natural signals as well as electrical signals on a single chip platform by integrating new MEMS/nano structures with low-power, wireless VLSI circuits and systems. We invite you to browse our website to learn more about us and our research. Self-Powered Image Sensor Could Watch You Forever 4/10/2018 Recently, IEEE Spectrum reported Dr. Sung-Yun Park,Kyuseok Lee and Hyunsoo Song's exciting work on Self-powered Image Sensor Check it out at IEEE Spectrum: https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/selfpowered-image-sensor-could-watch-you-forever Prof. Yoon received Ted Kennedy Family Faculty Team Excellence Award. 4/4/2018 Read More at: http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2018/combat-team-award.html Prof. Yoon gave the keynote talk at 2017 LNF User Symposium 12/6/2017 Prof. Yoon gave a talk titled "Biointerface Technologies: Where Engineering Meets Science and Medicine" at the yearly LNF User Symposium.
