I graduated from University of Barcelona as Ph.D. with a thesis on assisting the training of deep neural networks with applications to computer vision. My research interests revolve around learning and visual perception. Currently, I am mainly tacklingmedical data analysis problems, such as segmentation of images and videos as well as feature selection. I believe that using deep learning techniques in this field, we can have a real impact on our society.
