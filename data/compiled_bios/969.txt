 Home Papers Courses Students Yang Xu My main research concerns the development of computational models that predict language change over time. My particular interest is in characterizing the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the emergence of word meanings, such that a potentially infinite range of ideas may be expressed via finite lexicons in the world's languages. I take an interdisciplinary approach that combines rich empirical data with methods drawn from natural language processing and machine learning, with the goal of understanding and constructing natural language.
