 Etienne Vouga - UT Austin Graphics Home Projects Courses Notes and Code Contact Welcome! I'm an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department and the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin. I was a PhD student at the Columbia Computer Graphics Group and a postdoc at Harvard SEAS . Office: GDC 5.508 Email: evouga@cs.utexas.edu Research : I am particularly interested in physical simulation , particularly of thin, elastic materials like cloth, hair, and paper, as they deform and collide; geometry processing and design , using advances in our mathematical understanding of discrete geometry to better manipulate and design using coarse, discrete data; and applying ideas from these areas to solving problems in computer graphics, computational mechanics, and scientific computing. Industry applications of my research include special effects simulations in The Hobbit and Tangled, and Artec's Shapify 3D portrait service. Teaching : This semester I am teaching a CS395T graduate class, "Physical Simulation and Animation for Computer Graphics." Prospective Students: Yes, I'm looking to hire talented graduate students interested in graphics! Please e-mail me if you are interested.
