 Tamara Berg is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her research straddles the boundary between computer vision and natural language processing, with forays into social network analysis and human vision. The common theme underlying each facet of Tamaras research agenda is how to integrate disparate, but complementary sources of information associated with images and video. Tamara received a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of WisconsinMadison in 2001, and then completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007 under the advisorship of Professor David Forsyth as a member of the Berkeley Computer Vision Group. Afterward, she spent one year as a research scientist at Yahoo! Research. From 2008-2013, Tamara was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Stony Brook University and core member of the consortium for Digital Art, Culture, and Technology (cDACT). She joined the Department of Computer Science in 2013.
