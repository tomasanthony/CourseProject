 Education PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame BS in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Springfield Biography Hometown Bellevue, WA Field of research/teaching Data Science What is your research focus in a bit more detail? Is your current research path what you always had in mind for yourself, or has it evolved? My research was specifically focused on the development and application of methods for learning from imbalanced data. Imbalanced data refers to problems, typically related to classification, where one group or class occurs less frequently. This imbalance can cause difficulty for algorithms that try to correctly distinguish between groups or classes, but often occurs in problems of significant importance, such as the detection of fraud which typically occurs infrequently, but with great consequence. What courses/subjects do you teach? Data Mining Machine Learning What do you find most rewarding about what you teach? I find it very rewarding when, by the end of a course, students can apply methods and tools to solve problems that they didnt know how to solve when the course began. I enjoy playing a role in empowering people to solve real problems. Where did you study? I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame in part to stay near my family in Illinois. What are the specifics of your industry experience? I work at SAP Concur as a data scientist. The work gives me hands-on experience with the practical aspects of developing insights from large bodies of data through applied statistics and machine learning. Where did you grow up/spend the most defining years of your childhood/young adulthood? I grew up in the midwest. I attended high school in Wisconsin, undergraduate school in Minnesota and Illinois, and graduate school in Indiana. :
