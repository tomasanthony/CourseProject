Kishan Mehrotra Research and Emeritus Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science [email&#160;protected] Degree: Ph. D., University of Wisconsin Lab/Center Affiliation: SENSE (Artificial Intelligence) Research Interests: Artificial intelligence Social networks Bioinformatics Current Research: My most recent publications belong to three areas: anomaly detection, identification of motifs, and community detection in social networks. In anomaly detection we are interested in detecting anomalousness of a multidimensional observation as well as anomalousness of a time series, and focus on using weighted rank-based approaches. In bioinformatics, we are interested in identifying gene interaction network but our recent work is on identifying simple and structured motifs among co-regulated genes, with particular emphasis on minimizing user provided parameters; because in absence of any information about the nature of motifs, a user is likely to have vague idea of what he/she is looking for.
