My research is currently focused designing algorithms for semantic understanding, question answering, and information extraction about different types of textual and visual data such as web data, news articles, scientific articles, and conversations. My prior research was on designing statistical relational frameworks to learn, control, and reason about complex dynamic domains. In particular my interests include: Natural Language Processing: question answering, language and vision, grounded language acquisition, semantic analysis, coreference resolution Machine Learning: deep learning, learning with weak supervision, statistical relational learning Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: probabilistic relational models Language-based Interactive systems: multimodal interaction, dialog Teaching CSE 573 - Artificial Intteligence I - Winter 2019 EE 511 - Introduction to Statistical Learning - Winter 2018 CSE 473 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Spring 2014 Contact Office: Paul Allen Center 470 Phone: (206) 221-3921 Email: hannaneh [at] washington [dot] edu Last modified 2012 Hannaneh Hajishirzi
