Barbara M. Anthony Associate Professor of Computer Science Expertise Approximation Algorithms, Network Design Problems. Selected areas in Operations Research, Graph Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory. Notable Achievements Dr. Barbara Anthony teaches a variety of computer science courses, including the introductory courses in Java and Data Structures, core courses in Discrete Math, Algorithms, and Programming Languages, electives in Databases, Operations Research, and Theory of Computation, and the capstone in Software Engineering. She has taught a First Year Seminar exploring the Internet and a variety of web applications, Colloquium in Computer Science, an a course designed to prepare students to compete in the International Collegiate Programming Contest. She sometimes teaches Introduction to Statistics on the Mathematics side of the department. She also has conducted numerous independent studies, from explorations of topics with first-year students through seniors doing research as part of an Honors project. She is currently the faculty advisor for UPE, the CS Honor Society, and is happy to help organize a number of CS-themed events throughout the year. Details about some of my research can be found in my publication list, but one of the reasons that I came to Southwestern is so that I can work with students on research projects, not all of which lead to publications, though some do. Descriptions of some of the projects with students follow. Student co-authors underlined.
