["Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering-ElectrophysicsEducation2017, Doctoral Degree, Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology2010, Master's Degree, Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology2008, Bachelor's Degree, Electrical Engineering, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru BiographyManuel Monge received the B.S. degree (with honors) in Electrical Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), Lima, Peru in 2008, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, CA in 2010 and 2017, respectively. He joined the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA as an Assistant Professor in August 2018. Before joining USC, he spent a year at Neuralink Corp., developing ultra-high-bandwidth brain-machine interfaces.  His research interests include integrated circuits and systems for medical electronics, analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, implantable and wearable medical devices, sensing and actuation of biological media, localization of devices inside the body, fully wireless systems, neural prostheses, and brain-machine interfaces.  Dr. Monge is the recipient of the 2017 Charles Wilts Prize from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Caltech for outstanding independent research in electrical engineering leading to a PhD, and the 2017 Demetriades-Tsafka-Kokkalis Prize in Biotechnology from the Division of Engineering and Applied Science at Caltech for the best thesis in the field of biotechnology. He was also the co-recipient of the 2015 IEEE CICC Best Student Paper Award, 2nd Place, and the recipient of the Caltech Rosen Scholarship in 2014. Research SummaryMy research interests focus on combining and integrating physical and biological principles into the design of integrated circuits to engineer miniature biomedical devices for fundamental research, medical diagnosis and treatment.Awards2017 Caltech-EAS Division Demetriades - Tsafka - Kokkalis Prize in Biotechnology or Related Fields2017 Caltech-EE Department Charles and Ellen Wilts Prize2015 IEEE-CICC Co-recipient of the IEEE CICC Best Student Paper Award, 2nd Place2014 Caltech-Rosen Bioengineering Center Rosen Scholar2013 Broadcom Third place winner of the Broadcom Foundation University Research Competition2009 Caltech Atwood Fellowship2008 EducationUSA and Fulbright Peru Opportunity Grant Scholarship2008 PUCP Best Student Award2007 PUCP Award of Research Initiation2005 PUCP ERA-PUCP FellowshipAppointmentsMing Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Electrophysics OfficePHE 612Charles Lee Powell Hall3737 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089USC Mail Code: 271 Contact Information(213) 821-5214manuel.monge@usc.eduWebsitesResearch WebsitePersonal Website"]
