My research interests include pervasive computing systems for smart health and well-being, broadening participation in computing, and evidence-based approaches to improving computer science education. Prior to joining Temple, I was a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am the PI and Directorof the STARS Computing Corps , a national alliance of over 50 colleges and universities with the mission to broaden participation in computing. STARS has engaged over 2,500college students in service learning projects with regional K12 schools, industry, and community partners to inform, engage, and prepare over 140,000 futurestudents for entry and success in college computing programs.I have also served as the PI and Director of theNSF-fundedSocially Relevant Computing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)Site at UNC Charlotteand I am now leading the REU Site in Pervasive Computing for Smart Health, Safety, and Well-being at Temple University. These experiences have served as a foundation for my role as co-PI in the Connected Learner project, a $2M CS education research project funded by NSF thataims torevolutionize undergraduate computer science education by connecting students to peers, connecting students to the profession, and connecting computing to a purpose.
