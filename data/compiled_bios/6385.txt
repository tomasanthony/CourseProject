I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University, where I have been a faculty member since September 2007. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in August 2007, an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2003, and a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay in May 2001.The primary focus of my research is computer security. I build and evaluate secure computer systems drawing inspiration and ideas from a number of related areas, such as cryptography, programming systems, program analysis, software engineering, formal methods and verification, mobile and cyber-physical systems, computer systems, and hardware architecture.
