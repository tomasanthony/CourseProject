Rogers Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto . I am affiliated with the Computer Group . I received my M.S. and Ph.D from Stanford University and my B.A.Sc from Engineering Science at the University of Toronto . My research goal is to make computer systems more secure and trustworthy. With the large degree that computing has permeated our lives, from mobile smartphones to ubiquitous cloud computing, it is crucial that this infrastructure that we rely so heavily on be secure and reliable. We trust computer systems more than ever, meaning that they must be transparent and protect our privacy. To achieve this goal, I take a variety of approaches to achieving this goal, including techniques using operating systems, computer architecture, formal verification and networking. I like to research and understand my ideas by building prototypes with my students. Over the years, weve built and open-sourced many software projects . More information about my research projects can be found on my Research page. I held a Canada Research Chair in Secure and Reliable Computer Systems from 2013-2018, and have been the recipient of a Connaught Global Challenge Award (2017), an Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation Early Researcher Award (ERA) (2008) and an SOSP 2003 best paper award for my work. I served as general chair for the ACM CCS 2018 conference and have served on numerous technical program committees of top conferences, such as IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, OSDI and ASPLOS. I served as associate editor for the IEEE Transcations on Cloud Computing from 2012-2016. I am a founding member of the IT3 Lab , a multidisciplinary lab working on improving transparency through technology and policy. I was a visiting research scientist at Google from 2016-2017 and served as Chief Security Architect at Enomaly , a Toronto-area startup, from 2009-2010, which was subsequently acquired by Virtustream . I was Associate Chair, Graduate Studies from 2012-2015. I collaborate with top researchers internationally, as well as many of the leading technology companies, such as Google, VMware and Telus. I have been principle investigator on many competitive grants, totaling over $15M of funding.

Prospective Students and Open Positions Post-Doctoral Fellows :I have several post-doctoral fellowship positions open. Please click here for the job description and criteria . Intrested candidates should fill out the Post-Doctoral Fellow Application Form . Research stream MASc and PhD Students: I am always looking for graduate students who are interested in making the systems we use more secure and private. Required background requires a solid understanding of operating systems and computer systems, with practical experience writing and implementing software. Security background is desirable but not required. Interested students should apply for graduate studies in ECE or CS. If you are specifically interested in joining my research group as a student, I have a standard set of questions I ask all interested applicants, which you can fill out in my Prospective MASc/PhD Information Form . If you are unsure whether to apply to ECE or CS, please fill out the form and indicate in the comments box at the bottom. You can find information on my current graduate students here . MEng Students: I occasionally accept exceptional MEng students for projects that match my research program. Applicants should have a minimum 3.7 GPA and extensive software development experience. If interested, please fill out an MEng Project Application . Undergradaute Students: Im looking for strong undergraduate students with interests in computer security. 2nd and 3rd year students will be given preference. If interested, please fill out this application form .
