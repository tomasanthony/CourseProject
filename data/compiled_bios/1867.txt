 Computer Lab Damon Wischik Damon Wischik I am a University Lecturer in the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory. I am a data scientista mathematical modeler, a programmer, and a data artist. About me Research What will be the VisiCalc the killer appfor big data? It will be a tool that makes it intuitive to dig into richly-structured data, to ask questions and test scenarios, and to navigate the vast real-world datasets that are now available. It will achieve this by building on a universal grammar of interactive visualisation. It will become as widespread as Microsoft Excel, and it will be the tool of choice for people in business, tech, science, journalism, and government, whenever they want to communicate quantitative ideas.
