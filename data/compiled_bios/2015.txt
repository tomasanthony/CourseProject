 Professor T.W. Lam BSc CUHK ; MS, PhD Washington Head of Department; Professor Tel: (+852) 2859 2172 Fax: (+852) 2858 4141 Email: twlam@cs.hku.hk Homepage: http://www.cs.hku.hk/~twlam Professor TW Lam joined HKU after receiving his PhD in Computer Science from University of Washington in 1988. He served as an associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering from 2001 to 2006 and is currently the Head of the Computer Science Department. His research ranges from theoretical analysis of algorithms to big data analytics for bioinformatics. He has published over 200 research articles in international conferences and journals, and the most impactful ones come from the engineering work in bioinformatics software. More recently, he has been aspiring to tackle industrial problems with intricate algorithmic techniques and has been awarded a number of ITF grants. Since 2014, he has been managing a startup company (co-founded with Professor D Cheung and Dr R Luo) to advance the bioinformatics technologies for analyzing high-throughput DNA sequencing data for clinical applications. Professor Lam loves teaching, especially in inspiring students in learning theoretical subjects. He has received several teaching awards from the Department and the Faculty, as well as a University-level research student supervisor award.
