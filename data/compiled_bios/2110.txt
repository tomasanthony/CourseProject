She is a winner of the 2015 IEEE Communications Society William R. Bennett Prize in the Field of Communications Networking. In 2016, Dr. Cho was selected for the 2013 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), which is the highest honor bestowed by the US government on outstanding scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers. Dr. Jin-Hee Cho received the BA from Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea and MA from Washington University in St. Louis, MO, USA. She also obtained MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Virginia Tech in 2004 and 2008, respectively. She is a senior member of the IEEE and a member of the ACM. Courses CS 5114: Theory of Algorithms (Graduate Course; Fall'18, Summer'12-15). This course covers methods to construct algorithms and to analyze algorithms in a graduate level. The main content to be covered in this course includes design and analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, sorting algorithms, graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, linear programming, single-source shortest paths, maximum flow, B-Tree, basic graph algorithms, and NP-completeness. The course website is available for registered VT students at the VT Canvas. CS 6204: Advanced Topics in Network Science (Graduate Course; Spring'19, Summer'16). This course will consist of two parts: (1) learning through the lectures to cover the key concepts of network theories including types of networks, mathematical representations of networks, measures and metrics of networks, the large-scale structure of networks, network models, and processes on networks; and (2) studying the state-of-art research papers published in the area of network science related to the content covered in the lecture. The course website is available for registered VT students at the VT Canvas. Recent Selected Publications ( Full List & Google Scholar ) H. Al-Hamadi, M. Saoud, I.R. Chen, and J.H.
