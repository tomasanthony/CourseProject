D. in Electrical Engineering from The Ohio State University in 1967. He was an assistant professor and then associate professor at Columbia University in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from 1967-1975. In 1975, he joined the School of Computer Science at McGill University and has been with the School since then, serving as its director from 1976-1983. He has been an ACM Fellow since 1994 and a member of the Canadian Chess Hall of Fame since 2001. His research has focused on search problems in artificial intelligence where two areas are of particular interest: chess-playing programs and automated theorem-proving programs. He has published seven books on these subjects and a number of research papers as well. He served as chairman of the ACM Computer Chess Committee from 1981 until 1997. In that capacity he organized the first Kasparov versus Deep Blue match (known as the ACM Chess Challenge) in 1996. The following year he served as head of the officials at the second Kasparov versus Deep Blue match won by Deep Blue. Through the 1970s and 1980s, his chess program Ostrich competed in five world championships, coming close to winning in 1974. Octopus and Theo, two automated theorem-proving programs developed over the last twenty-five years are the current focus of his work. They both competed in the 2006 World Championship for ATP Systems in Seattle, Washington. Octopus, a multiprocessor version of Theo, ran on 133 PCs in the School's laboratories during the competition, searching in parallel for proofs of theorems chosen by the competition's organizers. In the 2004 competition, Octopus performed admirably, solving more theorems among those that no entry had seen before than any other entry. Octopus and Theo finished best of the North American entries. Publications Books Beyond Deep Blue: Chess in the Stratosphere, Springer-Verlag, 2011 (at amazon.com) .

[Crafty, one of the leading chess engines was tested on a number of chess king and pawns endgame positions, and the great progress over the last 40 years was reported.] Wang, Z., and Newborn, M., "Octopus: Combining learning and parallel search," Journal of Automated Reasoning , v. 33, n. 2, pp. 171-218, 2004. [Octopus is an automated theorem proving program that combines learning and parallel search. Running on more than 100 PCs, each computer initially attempts to prove a "weaker" or simpler version of a given theorem. If a proof is found, it uses what it learned to help prove the given theorem. Exactly what is a weaker version and what is learned and then used from its proof are the subject of this paper.] Newborn, M., and Wang, Z., Proofs of Nineteen More 1.0 Rated Theorems in the TPTP Problem Library, School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, January 2004, Technical Report SOCS-04.1. Newborn, M., Proofs of Twenty-Four 1.0-Rated Theorems in the TPTP Problem Library, School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, July 2003, Technical Report SOCS-03.6 with appendices. [Octopus has been tested over the years on many of theorems from the TPTP Problem Library. This library is a database of more than 7000 theorems used by researchers in automated theorem proving for testing their systems. Approximately 1000 of these theorems are assigned a rating of 1.0 indicating that no ATP system has obtained a proof thus far when the ATP system was run under the auspices of the database creators. Though not run under the auspices of the database creators, Octopus, nevertheless has proved 43 of these 1.0 rated theorems, and the above two SOCS technical reports present their proofs. Some of the proofs involve several hundred inferences.
