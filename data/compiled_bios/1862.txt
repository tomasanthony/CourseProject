 Simone Teufel University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory William Gates Building, JJ Thompson Ave , CAMBRIDGE CB3 0FD, United Kingdom. work: (+44) 1223 763643, fax: (+44) 1223 334678 email: sht25@cl.cam.ac.uk . Professor in Information and Language at the NLIP group at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (formerly: Computer Laboratory) of the University of Cambridge Research My area of research is text understanding. In particular, I develop models of discourse structure and argumentation in scientific text, and comprehension models for text summarisation. I am also interested in how "folk logic" connects to linguistic expressions, which is particularly of interest for argument mining. The logical structure of a text is an important dimension of its meaning, and several applications could profit from its analysis -- for instance text summarization, scientific search engines, improved bibliometrics, detection of "hot ideas" in a scientific field, and tools for better academic writing. I have proposed a discourse analysis called Argumentative Zoning or AZ, which is based on the recognition of the following phenomena: sentiment expressed towards cited work, ownership of ideas, and speech acts which express rhetorical statements typical for scientific argumentation. Co-reference between entities mentioned in text, and coherence of text pieces also plays an important role in my model. I am also interested in cognitive experiments to prove the use of this type of robust processing in a real user environment, particularly in task-based evaluations. Biography My first degree in Computer Science is from the University of Stuttgart, more specifically from the Center for Computational Linguistics (IMS) . At the IMS, I was involved in designing the STTS tagset for German corpora, and also was a member of the EAGLES corpus and lexicon standardisation group. I also spent some time at XRCE Xerox in Grenoble, working on the extraction of nominalizations and collocations. I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in 2000. My PhD thesis (on Argumentative Zoning) is available here . During my PhD, I was also a member of the HCRC Language Technology Group . During a Postdoc at Columbia University (2000-2001), I worked on the Digital Libraries Project PERSIVAL whose aim it is to provide patient-specific access to large collections of scientific articles, amongst others. In a subpart of the project, we reranked the output of searches in the field of cardiology to those articles which are of relevance to one particular patient the cardiologist is currently considering. I also worked on the TIDES project on multilingual summarization at Columbia. I joined the NLIP group at the University of Cambridge in 2001 as a lecturer, and have been Professor in Information and Language since 2017. Most of my funded research involves text understanding or text mining, summarisation and search from scientific articles or from language learner texts. Projects I am/was involved in the following research projects: FUSE (Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition): Detecting the emergence of ideas from the scientific literature SciBorg (Semantic analysis of chemistry papers) CitRAZ (Citation relations and Argumentative Zoning) FlySlip (Curation support for genetics papers) FUSE (Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition) Corpora I was involved in the creation of the following corpora (either in projects or with students), which are distributed here: AZ corpus -- 80 annotated computational linguistics articles (from my PhD work) Citation Function Classification corpus -- 161 annotated computational linguistics files (created in the CitRAZ project) Sciborg corpus -- 50 annotated chemistry articles (created in the SciBorg project) Awais Athar's Citation Sentiment corpus and Citation Context corpus Publications My publications are online here.
