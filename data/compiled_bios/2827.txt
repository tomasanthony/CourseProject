Cheriton School of Computer Science	200 University Ave W	Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1	Canada	Office:	DC 3524	Email:	florian.kerschbaum@uwaterloo.ca	Note that I use strict spam filtering (due to a huge amount of spam) and if you think your email did not reach me, please use alternative means to contact me.	About me	I am an associate professor in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo (since 2017) and executive director of the Waterloo Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute (since 2018).	Before I worked as chief research expert at SAP in Karlsruhe (2005  2016) and as a software architect at Arxan Technologies in San Francisco (2002  2004).	I hold a Ph.D. in computer science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2010) and a master's degree from Purdue University (2001).	I am interested in data security and privacy in data management, machine learning, and blockchains.	I extend real-world systems with cryptographic security mechanisms to achieve (some) provable security guarantees.	My work has been applied to products for databases, supply chain management and RFID tracking.	Students	I have a post-doc position in data security and applied cryptography with negotiable start date.	For details please see here.
