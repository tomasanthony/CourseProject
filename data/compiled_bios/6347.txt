My primary research interest is in theoretical foundations of big data analysis. This in particular includes sublinear algorithms and lower bounds in various models of computation for processing massive datasets such as streaming, distributed communication, and sublinear time algorithms. More broadly, I am also interested in communication complexity, online algorithms, and algorithmic game theory.I have recently obtained my PhD fromthe department of Computer & Information Science at University of Pennsylvania, where I was fortunate to have Sanjeev Khanna as my advisor. My PhD thesis, "Combinatorial Optimization on Massive Datasets: Streaming, Distributed, and Massively Parallel Computation", focuses on several fundamental combinatorial optimization problems in graph theory and submodular optimization in modern models of computation for processing massive datasets.
