"At last man is to know truth about everything. It suffices that he should not lose heart at the complexity of the problems, and that he should allow no passion to cloud his mind." -- Jose Ortega y Gasset -- Gabriel Ghinita Associate Professor Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts at Boston Office: Science Building, 3rd Floor, Room 88 (S-3-88) Phone: (617) 287-6479 Email: Gabriel.Ghinita at umb.edu Bio Publications Research I am an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Boston. For the 2018/19 AY, I am on sabbatical leave as Visiting Associate Professor at the Computer Science department, University of Southern California. Prior to joining UMB in Fall 2011, I was a Research Associate affiliated with Purdue Cyber Center and Purdue Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) . My main research interests lie in the area of databases, with focus on information security and privacy. I am also interested in spatio-temporal databases and data management in large-scale distributed environments.
