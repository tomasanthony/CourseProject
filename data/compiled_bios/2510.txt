He is the OKIE State mascot. I am not in the picture above. I have been a faculty member in the Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University since 1970 except for brief periods spent at other universities. For my professional history, please see my brief (without publications) resume'. In response to many on the net, I do have a life beyond my profession.
