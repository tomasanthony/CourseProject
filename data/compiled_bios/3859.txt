I am a Principal Lecturer. I joined the faculty in the summer of 2004. My first assignment was to restructure the introductory courses (cse142 and cse143). Now that I have finished that, I am trying to figure out what to do next. This quarter I am teaching cse143 . I have set up a resource page for my talk at SIGCSE 2008 on "The Mystery of b := (b = false)." I have an older resource page for my talk at SIGCSE 2006 on "Back to Basics in CS1 and CS2." I have published a cs1 textbook with Marty Stepp called Building Java Programs .
