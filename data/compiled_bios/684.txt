SHIN () I am the Kevin and Nancy O'Connor Professor of Computer Science, and the Founding Director of the Real-Time Computing Laboratory (RTCL) in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at The University of Michigan. I am currently leading several major research projects in the areas listed below, applying their results to real-life applications, and educating students and industry engineers. Mobile wireless networking and computing, including cognitive-radio or software-defined wireless networks, gigabit wireless LANs, mobile devices and apps. Computation and network security, including location privacy protection, self-securing mobile handsets, botnets, malware classification, and application protection in untrusted environments. Cyber-physical systems by integratingreal-time embedded applications and system SW with real-life physical systems like large-scale enery storage systems, ground and space vehicles; low-power embedded real-time OS, scheduling theory, middleware, and networks. Resilient cloud computing service and operation via virtualization-based server consolidation, replication and resource management. Click here for details of these projects and recent publications.
