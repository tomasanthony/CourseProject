I also like to follow my instincts and I strive to do things that are research-creative and seem disruptive or crazy at first. As time has marched on, Ive developed three tenets to my research : 1) Do something cool, exciting, fun, and (just maybe) transformative; 2) Find someone thats crazy enough to join in; and 3) Dont work with jerks. Thats not to say all the work Ive done has followed these principles; in contrast, these tenets evolved from my mistakes over the years more than anything else.

Kirk W. Cameron (PI). Personal share: $402,203. If there is anything Im widely known for, it is green HPC and data centers. Originally entitled High-performance, power-aware computing or HPPAC, this proposal, written in 2003 and based on ideas I first had in 2000-2001, is the first known submitted and funded research project in Green HPC energy efficient large-scale systems. The research plan was years ahead of the community and the resulting work inspired hundreds (perhaps thousands) of researchers worldwide to study energy use in data centers and supercomputers. This work led to my co-founding Green500.org , my being a founding member of SPECPower , my early influence on the energy star program for servers , and the co-founding ofenergy-efficient software startup MiserWare, Inc. The original proposal name was adopted by colleagues for the IEEE HPPAC workshop at IPDPS that will celebrate 15 years in 2019.

This poster is the first published work on Green Computing for HPC. This single poster described 1) motivation of the dire need for Green HPC later adapted and used by hundreds of papers to justify this new field of inquiry; 2) a system power measurement methodology adopted by the Green500 and adapted for SPECPower ; and 3) power management techniques that were later revisited by dozens of research groups worldwide and still cited as seminal today.

This is my favorite article that I wrote during that tenure and it received the most feedback from readers. Cameron, K.W. and Pruhs, K. (eds.), NSF Report on the Science of Power Management, pp. 37, submitted to the National Science Foundation August 2010. (Technical Report No. VT/CS-09-19). This was an influential report that resulted from a workshop sponsored by NSF and organized by me and a colleague. The report led to a funded program at the NSF. [Patented Power-Performance Guarantees] K.W. Cameron and J. Turner, Systems, devices, and/or methods for managing energy usage , [United States Patent: 8,918,657] [UK Patent: #GB2476606B]. This patent is a technique for bounding performance loss while maximizing power efficiency. This was the core technology use by MiserWare, Inc. to design the grano.la software. Grano.la reduced computer energy use up to 30% and was used by hundreds of thousands of people in more that 160 countries plus a number of universities and 3-letter agencies. MiserWare was a venture backed startup spun out of Virginia Tech. IMPACT ON POWER-PERFORMANCE MODELING [Power-Performance Modeling] *Ge, R., & Cameron, K. W. (2007). Power-aware speedup. Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing (pp. 1-12). IEEE. This is the first in a series of papers where I wanted to better understand the fundamental tradeoffs between power and performance at scale. The insight here was that energy efficiency in scalable systems results from exploiting inefficiencies in performance (e.g., communication overhead). Since existing models (e.g., Amdahls Law) ignore overhead, we generalized Amdahls Law to incorporate overhead and demonstrate the speedups possible in power-scaled systems. *Song, S., *Su, C. -Y., *Ge, R., Vishnu, A., & Cameron, K. W. (2011). Iso-energy-efficiency: An approach to power- constrained parallel computation . Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing (pp. 128-139). IEEE. This is the second in a series of papers where I wanted to better understand the fundamental tradeoffs between power and performance at scale. The insight here was that if given a power cap at runtime we can control variables such as workload, number of nodes and number of threads, to maintain a fixed energy efficiency as we scale an application and system. Maintaining an iso-efficient configuration enables us to maximize performance at scale under a power cap. *Li, B., Len, E. A., & Cameron, K.W.

Washington, DC: ACM. doi: 10.1145/3078597.3078601 [19% accept rate] Karsten Schwan Memorial Best Paper Award (1/100 submits). This is the third in a series of papers where I wanted to better understand the fundamental tradeoffs between power and performance at scale. This work draws attention to the fact that while hardware and software designers have spent decades increasing parallelism and computation/memory overlap, no models capture the separation of CPU or memory performance from overlap. This fundamental omission results in inaccurate performance prediction of simultaneous changes in computational throughput demonstrated with CPU, memory, and concurrency throttling. The Compute-Overlap-Stall model was shown to be the most accurate model for performance prediction under such conditions.

This work showed that faster performing processors sometimes lead to slower application performance. This students dissertation led to pending changes in the Linux journaling system and opencopy. These findings also led to two follow-on projects: the first related to exploiting slowdowns in advanced computing systems and the second related to understanding software variability . SELECT PROJECTS VarSys (2016-) is a collaboration at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and statistics to isolate, understand, and manage variability in software for high-performance and cloud-based systems.
