 Maria Gorlatova Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Dr. Maria Gorlatova's research is focused on reaching the next level of adaptive intelligent behavior in Internet of Things systems and applications. This research involves the development of architectures, algorithms, and protocols for emerging pervasive systems. It crosses traditional discipline boundaries and requires thinking across multiple layers of system and protocol stacks. Dr. Gorlatova earned her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, and her M.Sc. and B.Sc. (Summa Cum Laude) degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Ottawa, Canada. She has several years of industry experience, where she had been affiliated with Telcordia Technologies, IBM, and D. E. Shaw Research. She came to Duke from Princeton University, where she held the positions of an Associate Research Scholar in the Electrical Engineering Department and an Associate Director of the Princeton EDGE Lab. Dr. Gorlatova is a recipient of the Google Anita Borg USA Fellowship, Canadian Graduate Scholar CGS NSERC Fellowships, the Columbia University Presidential Fellowship, and the Columbia University Jury Award for Outstanding Achievement in Communications. She is a co-recipient of the ACM SenSys Best Student Demonstration Award, the IEEE Communications Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and the IEEE Communications Society Award for Advances in Communications.

University of Ottawa (Canada), 2007 B.S. University of Ottawa (Canada), 2004 Research Interests Architectures, algorithms, and protocols for emerging mobile pervasive systems and the Internet of Things. Our work crosses traditional discipline boundaries and requires thinking across multiple layers of system and protocol stacks. We are focusing on breaking the barriers for technologies that enable fundamentally new deployments and experiences, such as energy harvesting, artificial intelligence adapted to the Internet of Things constraints, and augmented reality.
