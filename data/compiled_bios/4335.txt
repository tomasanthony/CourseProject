NEW In addition, I teach professional courses on Low Power Computing and Multicore Computing in universities (for Masters and Ph.D. level students), and industry. With power and parallelism now in the front and center of any system design, this is course seeks to train the workforce in the fundamentals, challenges, basic and some advanced solutions. To see if your students or employees need this course, please see the course contents here . Note to new Students If you are a student at ASU, and some of the topics that I work on engage you, the way to get into my team starts by doing well in one of my classes. If you are a prospective student, please go through my inquiry page to see if there is some challenge that particularly strikes you, and you would like to take on. I am not taking any students for summer internships, so please do not enquire. Mails about internship will not be answered.
