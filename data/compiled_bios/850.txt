Hi! I'm a computer scientist and physicist who ispassionate aboutparticipating in a journey withstudents to discover the wonders and beauty of the world around us and to learn how we can use computing to both achieve our goals as well as tocreate greaterunderstanding. Please feel free to browse around and learn a little more about me! Standard short bio... Dr. Wong, a Lecturer of Computer Science at Rice University, is an experienced computer scientist, physicist and educator specializing in object-oriented programming, software engineering and computer science pedagogy. A Howard Hughes Ph.D. Fellow, he received his Ph.D. in experimental solid state physics from M.I.T. in 1988 and worked at Bell Labs and Hughes Research Labs before entering academia.His industrial research and software consultingexperience includes optical semiconductor physics withto-be-Nobel laureate Steven Chu,high-temperature superconductors, engineered bandgap materials, website designandchemicalkinetics modeling.Over the course of histwo decadesof academic experience he has taughta wide range ofcomputer science, physics and mathematics courses. He has published numerous papers and run many seminars on design patterns and C.S. pedagogy. He has designed and taught innovative introductory objects-first courses leveraging the power of interactivity to teach fundamental C.S. concepts and skills. He pioneered a cutting-edge experientially-driven, discovery-learning process software engineering course where highly realistic software engineering situations that require solutions using state-of-the-art design, information management and project management skills. His currentresearch includes the use design patterns in redesigning traditional algorithms, serious gaming systems, cloud-based enterprise information management systems, large-scale, high-fidelity simulation systems and technologies for massive open on-line courses.
