 Siu-Wing Cheng Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering HKUST, Clear Water Bay Hong Kong Email: scheng@cse.ust.hk Tel: 852 23586973 Fax: 852 23581477 I enjoy doing research in algorithms, data structures, and computational geometry. Some of the research topics that I have worked on include point location , approximate shortest paths , mesh generation , and reconstruction of surfaces and manifolds , and shape matching . I have written a book, Delaunay Mesh Generation , with Tamal Dey and Jonathan Shewchuk . It is a thorough guide to Delaunay triangulation and mesh generation by Delaunay refinement.
