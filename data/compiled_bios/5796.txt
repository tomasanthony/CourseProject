Benjamin Shapiro, 2002). Upcoming events that I'm involved with: S&P 2019 (May 1923, 2019) CSET 2019 (August 2019) NSPW 2019 (Aug/Sept/Oct 2019) Staff Scientist, Data Science and Technology Dept., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Associate Adjunct Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, University of California, Davis Associate Adjunct Professor, Dept. of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis School of Medicine Chief Cybersecurity Strategist, Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California (CENIC) I lead applied research and development in computer security at the Berkeley Lab and UC Davis. I am also chief cybersecurity strategist for CENIC, and Senior Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Security & Privacy, and associate editor-in-chief of IEEE Security & Privacy. These days, my current focus is research and development of security and privacy techniques that improve and enable the secure use of distributed, high-performance and cloud computing resources to conduct scientific research, and improve the secure functioning of power grid control systems. At CENIC, I am responsible for cybersecurity strategy and implementation for CENIC's enterprise as well as for the CalREN network backbone, and direct of the CENIC/ESnet Joint Cybersecurity Initiative In the past, I have worked on areas including intrusion detection, computer forensics, insider threats, vulnerability analysis, elections, and security metrics. I also teach and advise grad students. I occasionally do some consulting. I was the General Chair of the 36th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland"). I received my Ph.D., Masters and Bachelors degrees in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
