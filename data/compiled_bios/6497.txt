 Ndapa Nakashole Assistant Professor Artificial Intelligence Group Department of Computer Science and Engineering Jacobs School of Engineering University of California, San Diego Office: EBU3B 4108 Email: nnakashole[at]eng.ucsd.edu CV Publications Research My research interests are in natural language processing and machine learning. Collectively, natural language processing(NLP) aims to develop algorithms that enable computers to understand and generate human language. My focus is on developing machine learning methods that learn language from text data. Specific problems I am interested in include: machine reading, question answering, representation learning, and NLP for low resource languages.
