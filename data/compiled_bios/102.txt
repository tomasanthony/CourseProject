Xin Lis research group focuses on the design of new energy related materials through advanced characterizations and simulations. By combining electrochemistry, (in situ) electron microscopy, (in situ) X-ray diffraction and first principles simulations, we try to understand the relationship between atomistic structure and electrochemical property of materials. The scientific understanding guides the design of new energy related materials with technological importance, especially energy storage materials such as cathodes, anode s and solid electrolytes for lithium or sodium ion batteries with improved energy density, cyclability and safety. The group is also interested in obtaining a general understanding on how microscopic interactions in the atomistic configurational unit can decide the collective behavior in layered metal oxides, such as NaTMO2 and unconventional superconductors.
