 Home (current) Research Publications Krishna Venkatasubramanian Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (collaborative appointment) Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Fuller Labs 137 100 Insitutue Road, Worcester, MA, 01609 : kven AT wpi DOT edu : 508-831-6571 : @k_deux_v Research Interests My research interests are in the areas of cyber-security, applied machine learning, wearable Internet-of-Things (wIoT), and assistive technologies. I am driven by a strong desire to develop computational solutions that are useful for helping vulnerable populations in our society. My research specifically focuses on: Designing authentication, clinicial, and personal safety solutions using wIoT and assistive technologies. Designing solutions to address real-world problems pertaining to people with a variety of disabilities and addiction disorders. I am affiliated with the following groups at WPI: ALAS, Practice Point , Healthcare Delivery Institute (HDI) and the Data Science program (DS). My research would not be possible without collaboration with these excellent institutions/groups: WPI AIM Lab, WPI Social Science, University of Massachusets Medical School (Emergency Medicine), Rhode Island Tech Access, HMEA, The NEAT Center, Massachusetts Disabled Persons Protection Commission (DPPC), and Boston Scientific Inc. Current Students I have been fortunate to work with some excellent graduate students : Brittany Lewis (PhD student) Alexander Kasparek (MS student) Currently I am working with the following undergraduate students : Rushdi Abualhaija, Meg Bhatia, Nikolaos Kalampalikis, Alejandro Soler Gayoso, and Zachary Vaughan Past Students Over the years I have also worked with several great students, including: PhD students: Hang Cai MS students: Joshua Hebert (first position @Linclon Labs), Rohitpal Singh, Alexander Witt (first position @MITRE), and Jian Xu (first position @ Amazon). Undergraduate students: Nick Brown, Ryan Crook, Natasha Danas, Jesse Earisman, Kenedi Heather, David Keeley-DeBonis, Douglas Lally, Nate Miller, Shivangi Pandey, Nilesh Patel, Patrick Plenefisch, Cynthia Rogers, Alex Solomon, Kunal Shah, John Synott, Sai Vadlamudi, and Steven Yevchak. Teaching I teach (or have taught) courses in undergraduate courses in Computer Networks, Software Security, and graduate courses in Computer Networks and Cyber-Physical Systems.
