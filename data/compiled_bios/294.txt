Before joining the School of Computing, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the Department of Politics at New York University , taught at the London School of Economics , and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Clemson's Social Analytics Institute. My research is in computational social science, with a focus on text analysis and big data analytics. My work develops and applies scalable solutions to process and extract knowledge from large volumes of unstructured data, such as speeches, social media, scientific publications, and newspaper articles. I use insights extracted from these data to study political and social problems in the areas of comparative politics, legislative behavior, and public policy-making.

In addition, the database contains background information on all TDs (Teachta Dla, members of parliament), such as their party affiliations, constituencies and office positions. The current version of the database includes close to 4.5 million speeches from 1,236 TDs. Data collection: The speeches were downloaded from the official parliament website and further processed and parsed with a Python script. Background information on TDs was collected from the member database of the parliament website. Data on cabinet positions (ministers and junior ministers) was collected from the official website of the government. A record linkage algorithm and human coders were used to match TDs and ministers. Acknowledgments: The data collection was supported in part by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and the Social Sciences. The Institute for International Integration Studies (IIIS) at Trinity College Dublin provided research facilities for parts of the project. Citation: Alexander Herzog and Slava Mikhaylov.
