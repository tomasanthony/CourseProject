Before coming to Caltech I was Assistant Professor in the Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) program and the Department of Philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis . In 2011 I took a two year research leave to work on causal discovery methods at Carnegie Mellon University with a grant from the James S. McDonnell Foundation . Before going to St. Louis I was a McDonnell postdoc at the Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley . I completed my Ph.D. in the Philosophy Department at Carnegie Mellon University . research My research interests lie at the formal end of philosophy of science, the machine learning end of statistics and computer science, and the learning and modeling end of psychology and cognitive science. My work has focused primarily on methods for causal discovery from statistical data, the use of experiments in causal discovery, the integration of causal inferences from different data sets and the philosophical issues at the foundations of causality and probability. I have done some work on computational models in cognitive science and some historical work on the philosophy of Hans Reichenbach, especially his frequentist interpretation of probability. education Ph.D., Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Philosophy , 2007.
