It will take place the week of June 18-21, 2019 in Portland, OR, USA. In the Fall 2018 semester (August 15 - December 15) I was on sabbatical, visiting the Simons Institue for Theoretical Computer Science at UC Berkeley , for the program on Foundations of Data Science . The University of Utah officially granted me tenure!, and I have been appointed Associate Professor in the School of Computing. Yan Zheng (joining Visa Research ) and Mina Ghashami (joining Rutgers CS as Postdoc with Muthu ) successfully defended their PhD Theses! I co-organized (with Jinhui Xu , and previously Jonathan Lechner and Eli Packer or Anne Driemel ) a CG-Week Workshop on Geometry and Machine Learning 2018 , 2018 , and 2016 . I co-organized (with Vivek Srikumar ) a Utah Data Science Day on January 13, 2017 in the Union Ballroom. I have been granted an NSF CAREER Award: Foundations of Geometric Analysis of Noisy Data . I organize a graduate Certificate in Big Data ; see stories from the U , the Salt Lake Tribune , the Daily Utah Chronicle , KPCW: Cool Science Radio , and the Utah Business Magazine . I post and live-stream many videos of my lectures on Youtube. They now appear on the Utah Data Youtube Channel . Older versions are here and here . I used to occasionally post on Geomblog including my experience in search for academic and research lab jobs . I co-organized (with Suresh ) an Algorithms in the Field-Computational Geometry (8F-CG) workshop during CG:APT at the Symposium on Computational Geoemtry in June 2012. Slides are now available.
