I won the NSF CAREER award (2004), to work on "Pattern Matching, Realistic Input Models and Sensor Placement. Useful Algorithms in Computational Geometry." I am on the editorial board of IJCGA and of JDA . I was a program committee member of SoCG05 , SoCG13 , Broadnets06 , 07 , 08 , 09 , ICC WAS ACM GIS 2007 , 08, 09, 11,12, 13,14, 15, 16, 18, ALGOSENSORS 08 and 11, FOCS 09 , INFOCOM 09 10 and 11, MILCOM 14 ,15. DRCN 15 , 16 , VISIGRAPP 15 . I was the co-chair of the sensor network algorithms track of ALGOSENSORS14 and a co-organizers of the workshop on Geometric Optimization in Wireless Communication and Sensing , in conjunction with SoCG 14 .

See TCE comments from Fall16 here and from Spring17 are here Previously taught courses Research Publications ( chronologically ), Publications ( by subjects ), CV, and my H-Index on Google Scholar The SLIC video browsing system. Media Network Protection and vulnerability here Astroid Detection TEDx Tucson Salon (Oct 2013) its abstract, and the talk. Students Jesus Arango, (Cisco Systems) Swaminathan Sankararaman (Akamai) Qiyam Tung (Amazon) Quick Links We are working on ways to schedule the motion of a swarm of UAV sweeping terrains looking for moving targets. See the demos here and here , and read the papers here and here. Qiyam Tung created a great youtube clip presenting some of our work on context-driven text expansion and its applications to the educational video browsing SLIC project . Check our Codpon Project in Brazil. Javad Taheri wrote cool applets for basestation location problems ( here ).
