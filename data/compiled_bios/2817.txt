[thx MCB]	Fierce, godly ham	Chiefly, mad ogre	Hey! decimal frog	Grey, modal chief	The past	During the 2011-12 academic year, I was on sabbatical at CWI in Amsterdam, with the RASCAL group (aka SEN-1, aka SWAT), led by Jurgen Vinju and Paul Klint. I learned a lot about programming, practical language design, DSLs, and the sheer joy of building something that works. I really enjoyed my time there, and the great people I got to work with, including Mark Hills, Davy Landman, Atze van der Ploeg, Tijs van der Storm, Jeroen van den Bos, Anastasia Izmaylova, and Vadim Zaytsev.	During the 2003-04 academic year, I was on sabbatical at Sun	Microsystems Research Lab in Mountain View, CA. I worked on two research	projects involving static analysis tools, Jackpot and Salsa, and I got to	work with a number of really sharp tool developers, including Michael Van	De Vanter, Tom Ball, Tim Prinzing, and James Gosling (all Jackpot), as well	as John Crupi, Deepak Alur, Yury Kamen, and Syed Ali (all Salsa).	I was a faculty member at Cornell	University between 1996 and 1998; I taught the software engineering	course and some others, and I was the associate director of their M.Eng.	program. I also did some work with the Predator	/ Jaguar	object-relational database project, which led to a paper	at SIGMOD-98.	Before that, I was a graduate student and occasional full-time lecturer at	the University of Toronto.	Michael W. Godfrey PhD, Associate Professor	David R.
