Parisa Kordjamshidi currently is an assistant professor of computer science at Tulane University and holds a joint appointment as a research scientist at IHMC. Her main research interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, Information extraction and Declarative learning based programming. She has worked on the extraction of formal semantics and structured representations from natural language, with a specific focus on spatial semantics representation. Her current research is dedicated to declarative learning based programming (DeLBP). The goal of this programming paradigm is to facilitate programming for building systems that require a number of learning and reasoning components that interact with each other and receive data from heterogeneous resources. Such a language would help machine learning researchers as well as experts in various domains who are not experts in machine learning, to design complex intelligent systems and evaluate them. She tries to develop such a language and apply it on various application domains.
