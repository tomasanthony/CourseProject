For a more complete list of my projects, please go to LANs home page. My general research interests include computer networks, wireless networks, sensor networks, mobile computing, and network security. I lead the Laboratory of Networked Systems (LANS) at Yale University. Previously, my primary research interest is on designing robust, efficient and fair computer networks, where autonomous, heterogeneous traffic controllers optimize their objectives measured by both traditional performance metrics and non-traditional metrics such as economical metrics and survivability. Research Highlights: Content Distribution We propose, design and implement multiple protocols and mechanisms to improve the efficiency and robustness of Internet content distribution. The P4P framework (SIGCOMM 2008) for ISP and content distribution app integration; see IETF ALTO Working Group for standardization effort. The Data Locker (SIGCOMM ICN 2012) framework for in-network storage. The ShadowStream framework (SIGCOMM 2012) for realsitic debugging. The CMO framework (SIGCOMM 2012) for cost and performance optimization. Robust, Efficient Internet Traffic Engineering (TE) We have designed and completely implemented the TORTE system, which is the first integrated traffic engineering, routing system that can handle topology failures, traffic variations, and service requirements (e.g., priority) with provable guarantees. A set of overview slides for intradomain TE (SIGCOMM 2010) Multihoming: one-hop interdomain TE (SIGCOMM 2004) Interdomain TE as social choice Ingress interdomain TE Egress interdomain TE Incentive-compatibility/Economics of Network Design We design and analyze protocols considering incentive-compatibility. P2P Live streaming Wireless mesh BGP as social choice Wireless Throughput Optimization We improve wireless throughputs by avoiding collisions to creating "beneficial" collisions such as superposition and matrix net. superposition coding and ipack remap and matrixnet Argos Network Localization We provide the first complete foundation of network localization. A set of overview slides Research Questions and Objectives: The central question driving much of my research is the following: What are the guiding principles and practical techniques for achieving robust and efficient computer networks? Our research methodology is to integrate rigorous analysis with careful system design, practical implementation, and whenever possible large-scale field tests with real users. The objective of rigorous analysis is to reveal and derive the most fundamental guiding principles and to provide provable guarantees. As an example, instead of an ad-hoc system design, our P4P framework derives the interfaces between networks and network applications through rigorous primal-dual optimization decomposition. The objective of system implementation and large-scale field tests is to ground the principles in the real world. Some of our systems have undergone extremely large-scale field tests (e.g., P4P has been test-deployed with millions of real users at five of the largest Internet service providers in the world); some of our tools have been used by multiple other groups around the world (e.g., TORTE and Network Localization).

I am fortunate to be able to work closely with a stellar group of students. There are many more interesting projects than we can actively pursue; thus, I am currently looking for motivated Ph.D. students. One way for checking if you have a reasonable background and if there is a potential match between my research interests and yours, is that you take a look at my current research papers, say those linked at the beginning of this page. If you feel comfortable understanding, and (potentially) criticizing those papers, please feel free to contact with me. This link contains much useful information for graduate students. Here is a link to prospective students, current students and prospective visiting researchers. I used to maintain a list of papers on computer networks. I suggest to my students that they read the papers, at least the red ones.
