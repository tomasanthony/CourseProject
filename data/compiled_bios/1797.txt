 Suresh Venkatasubramanian Home About Bio News Press Research Papers Students Teaching Service Funding I'm a professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. My research interests are a random walk through the theoretical and applied aspects of data science, including computational geometry, sublinear algorithms, clustering, and kernel methods. I'm currently very interested in the social ramifications of automated decision making. I'm a founding member of the organization FAT* and have helped run the last three FATML workshops . I'm also a member of the board at the ACLU of Utah and a member of the Computing Community Consortium Council. News Feb 14: " Runaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing " was covered by Caroline Haskins (Motherboard): Academics Confirm Major Predictive Policing Algorithm is Fundamentally Flawed . Feb 14: I'm at ITA , participating in the privacy and fairness plenary session . Feb 6: Two news articles covered our paper "Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems" ( The Next Web , and Technology Review ). For more, see my news page Research I'm interested in the problem of algorithmic fairness : ensuring that in a world of automated decision-making, decisions that get made about us and for us are fair, accountable and transparent. This is the culmination of a series of research explorations that started with algorithms and computational geometry, lifted to high dimensional geometry and sublinear algorithms, with a random sampling of work in clustering and kernel methods.
