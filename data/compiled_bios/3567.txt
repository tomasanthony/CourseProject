Introduction to Communication Networks , TuTh 5:30PM - 6:59PM, Cory 521 . Biography Shyam Parekh received his Ph.D. in EECS from UC Berkeley. His research interests are in the architecture, optimization and performance aspects of both wired and wireless Communication Networks. Recently, he has been investigating the analytic issues related to the evolving paradigms of SDN, NFV and data-plane programming. He is the co-author of "Communication Networks: A Concise Introduction" (Morgan & Claypool, First Edition (2010), Second Edition (2018)), and a co-editor of "Quality of Service Architectures for Wireless Networks: Performance Metrics and Management" (Information Science Reference, 2010). He was a co-chair of the Application Working Group (AWG) of the WiMAX Forum during 2008-09. . . Selected Publications P. Maille, S. Parekh, and J.
