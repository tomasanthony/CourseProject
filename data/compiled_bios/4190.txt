Linh's interests include real-time systems, embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing. Her research develops theoretical methods, analysis tools, and platform support for building complex systems efficiently and with provable safety and timing guarantees. She is especially interested in techniques that integrate theory, systems, and application aspects. Recently, she has been working on methods for defending cyber-physical systems against malicious attacks, as well as on real-time cloud infrastructures for safety-critical and mission-critical systems.
