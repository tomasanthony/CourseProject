Ripley Professor of Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 323 607/255-6317 Associate Director of Electrical and Computer Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering farhan.rana@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Farhan Rana is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. He received the B.S., M.S. (1997), and Ph.D. (2003) degrees all in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before starting the Ph.D., he worked at IBM's T. J.Watson Research Center on nanocrystal and quantum dot memory devices. He joined the faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in 2003. He received the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Young Faculty Award in 2008, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award in 2004, the ILX Lightwave faculty award in 2005, Cornell's Michael A. Tien Excellence in Teaching Award in 2006 and also in 2010, and the Gold Medal for Academic Performance by the Government of Pakistan. He has also received several best paper awards including the "Most Downloaded Paper" title in 2008 by the IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology. He current serves as Associate Director of the School of Electrical and Comptuer Engineering at Cornell University.. Research Interests Established and leads the semiconductor optoelectronics research group at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The underlying themes behind most of the research carried out by the group is understanding and engineering of the properties of electrons, photons, spins, and phonons in semiconductor micro and nano structures in order to realize novel devices, study new science at small scales in both space (micro- and nano-sized materials and devices) and time (ultrafast optical and terahertz spectroscopy and devices), and use novel physics to solve engineering problems and tackle scientific challenges in the development of new technologies. Advanced Materials Processing Advanced Materials Nanotechnology Semiconductor Physics and Devices Nonlinear Dynamics Solid State, Electronics, Optoelectronics and MEMs Research Group Members. Teaching Interests Established four new courses in the Department curriculum in six years: 1) ECE4070: Physics of Semiconductors and Nanostructures 2) ECE5310: Quantum Optics 3) ECE3030: Electromagnetic Fields and Waves 4) ECE533: Semiconductor Optoelectronics..
