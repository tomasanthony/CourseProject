PhD applicants: I may be able to take on 12 new PhD students, and in particular look for applicants interested in hardware security, side-channel analysis, statistical signal processing, and/or radio-frequency electronics. See also below for the one funded studentship opportunity I have available next year for a UK student to work on side-channel analysis. I'm happy to discuss your research proposals informally any time, but please send formal application documents through the University's graduate admissions system (i.e., please do not email me CVs, transcripts, or references). Internships and visits: Since quite regularly get email applications for internships: please note that I do not usually have any funding available for interships. Hardware-security PhD studentship PhD Studentship in Side-Channel Security I will be able to offer one 3.5-year PhD studentship on side-channel security, starting in October 2019, to applicants interested in hardware security, radio communication, experiments with software-defined radio hardware, and digital signal processing. The basic idea of the project is to investigate, how radio waves reflected from an electronic device can pick up side-channel information about the processed data, and how that can be reconstructed and used to enhance eavesdropping range in comparison to purely passive electromagnetic eavesdropping attacks. Applicants should have an undergraduate or masters degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics or Physics. Please contact me by phone or email for more information before submitting a formal application. Note: Due to the UK government funding source, this studentship is restricted to UK nationals, or applicants who have been resident in the UK for the past 10 years, and subject to the candidate being able to obtain a UK DV security clearance. official advert How to apply: PhD in Computer Science applications and admission On the formal application, please quote the advert code NR17902.
