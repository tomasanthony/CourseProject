Specific research areas include (1) source code analysis and transformation, specifically on automatic differentiation, performance analysis, and empirical code tuning; (2) embeddable domain-specific languages for high-performance computing; and (3) quality of service infrastructure for scientific software (including numerical software taxonomy and automated configuration), for optimizing performance, energy use, and resilience of complex applications. I direct the High-Performance Computing Laboratory (HPCL) , where you can find more details and recent news on our research projects. Personal
