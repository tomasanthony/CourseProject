My research examines human-centered computing in digital arts practice. I designed and developed a creative coding environment for the browser, Gibber , that I use both for educational research and audiovisual performances. Gibber is used to teach computational media to middle school, high school and university students in locations around the world, and I've performed with it throughout the US, UK and Asia in the experimental performance genre known as live coding .
