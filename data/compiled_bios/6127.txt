Makan Fardad Associate Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 3-189 CST 315.443.4406 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): BSc in Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran, 1998. MSc in Control Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, 2000 PhD in Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, 2006 Research Interests: Optimization and design problems in dynamical networks; Synchronization and consensus in multi-agent networks; Optimal control subject to sparsity/architectural constraints. Current Research: Makan Fardads research interests are in the analysis and optimization of dynamical networks. Particular focus is on extending ideas from controls, dynamical systems, and optimization theory to problems in network science. Application areas include synchronization of oscillator networks, optimal control of vehicular formations, design of sensor networks, and problems in social networks such as community detection, leader selection, and consensus formation.
