His primary research interests are in file and storage systems and, more generally, distributed systems and operating systems. His current projects include archival storage systems, scalable file system indexing, file systems for next-generation storage technologies, file system security, and petabyte-scale storage systems. His research interests also include storage system benchmarks, algorithms to more efficiently manage storage, and information retrieval from very large text and multimedia corpora as well as other problems in computer systems and security.
