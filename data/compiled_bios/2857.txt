Peter van Beek | Home	Peter van Beek	Cheriton School of Computer ScienceUniversity of Waterloo	Home	Publications	Research	Service	Teaching	Contact	I am a Professor in the Cheriton School of Computer Science	at the University of Waterloo.	I received my PhD in 1990 from the University of	Waterloo and at that time joined the faculty at the	University of Alberta. Ten years later I returned to Waterloo.	My research interests span the field of Artificial	Intelligence with a focus on	representation and reasoning, constraint programming,	constraint satisfaction, and applied machine learning.	I have co-authored seven research papers which have	won awards, and I have served on the program committees of	many conferences and on the editorial boards of several	journals.	From 2005-2009, I served as Editor-in-Chief of the journal	Constraints, a forum for research in constraint programming	and constraint satisfaction and optimization.	In 2008, I was named a Fellow of the Association	for Artificial Intelligence.	Conference activities	Senior PC, IJCAI-2019	PC member, AAAI-2019	PC member, CP-2019	Recent talks	Machine Learning of Bayesian Networks,	31st Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018	(slides).	Handbook of CP	The aim of this	handbook	is to capture the full breadth	and depth of the constraint programming field and	to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage.
