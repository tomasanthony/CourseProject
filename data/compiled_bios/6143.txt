Andrew C. Lee Assistant Teaching Professor, Systems and Information Science Program Director Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-291 CST 315.443.3029 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D. (U. of Maryland, College Park, 1998); M.A. (U. of Maryland, College Park, 1996); M.A. (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1988); B.A. (U. of Hong Kong, 1987). Research Interests: Discrete Mathematics Computability Theory Computational Learning Artificial Intelligence Logic and Formal Methods Current Research: I study the role of queries and the associated learning strategies in solving computational problems. For example, the strategies for playing many board games and on-line games often resemble a basic paradigm in machine learning, namely, to learn a target concept via queries. By studying the (winning) strategies in specific concrete games, we may gain insights to determine the right set of queries and related parameters that are of interest in machine learning applications. I am also interested in graph coloring and graph labeling type problems. Many arise quite naturally in the study of social structures and networks. To better understand them it often requires new algorithms and analysis. As an educator, I am interested in engaging students to do research. In addition, I like to explore new pedagogies to improve students reasoning ability, develop their inquisitiveness and strengthen their problem solving skills. Along in this direction I like to cast some of the research problems listed above in elementary settings and make them accessible to undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
