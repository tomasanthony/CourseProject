 Susan E. Brennan Professor, Department of Psychology Joint appointment, Computer Science Associated, Department of Linguistics Department of Psychology Telephone: (631) 632-9145 S.U.N.Y. at Stony Brook Fax: (631-632-7876 Stony Brook, NY 11794-2500 Email: susan dot brennan "at" stonybrook dot edu I am a cognitive scientist who studies the psychology of language usein particular, interactive spoken dialogue. I am interested in how people adapt their speaking and understanding to their conversational partners and to the variation that is rampant in speech. Some of my current studies use eye-tracking, either as a measure of language processing or as a mode of communication . My recent interests include the neural circuits that support interactive communication. I also study the human use of technology, especially speech and language interfaces to computers. Long, long ago , I developed a computational model of caricature .
