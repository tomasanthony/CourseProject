Ted Pavlic Ted Pavlic, an assistant professor appointed jointly with CIDSE and the School of Sustainability, studies autonomous decision-making systems using a combination of theoretical and empirical methods. His research seeks out unifying theoretical frameworks of rational behavior that cut across biology, economics, and engineering. Some projects in his highly interdisciplinary laboratory study animal systems directly to gain insight into how nature has solved complex decision-making challenges without the advanced communication capabilities assumed to be present in most engineered systems. In other projects, automation systems are constructed to show how relatively simple decision-making rules can be both robust and adaptive. Previously, he worked as a behavioral ecologist in a social-insect laboratory, which followed working as a computer science researcher studying automated verification of mixed-autonomy urban intelligent transportation systems. He views ASUs size and disciplinary breadth as an asset for understanding how behavioral analysis can be used in the design of sustainable, resilient automation systems across a wide range of applications  from robotics to control of power distribution to the design of human decision-support systems. To that end, he is on the graduate faculty of a wide range of programs  including, but not limited to, Industrial/Electrical/Computer/Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering  and he is excited about working with a mixture of students from different disciplines in order to solve use-inspired problems in autonomous systems. tpavlic@asu.edu 480-965-2899 BYENG 314 Education Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2010 M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2007 B.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2004 Research interests Distributed algorithms, autonomous systems, decentralized decision making, complex adaptive systems, self organization, hybrid dynamical systems, sustainability in the built environment, behavioral ecology, behavioral economics, operations research, bio-mimicry and bio-inspiration, parallel computation, robotics,energy systems, intelligent control; optimization; game theory; resource allocation; collective behavior Key activities  Joint appointment with School of Sustainability Editorial board member for Human Computation Review editorial board member for Frontiers in Robotics and AI, Computational Intelligence Officer of IEEE Special Technical Community for Human Computation Associate Director for Research, The Biomimicry Center at ASU External faculty for Human Computation Institute Program Committee, 2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Control Program Committee, 2015 Conference on Complex Systems Invited participant of 12th Annual National Academies Keck Futures Initiative Conference on Collective Behavior Organizer or invited participant for a wide variety of interdisciplinary workshops across science and engineering   January 25, 2017 Erik Wirtanen                      Sign In / Sign Out    Sign In     Menu    ASU Home  My ASU   Colleges & Schools   Arts and Sciences  Business  Design and the Arts  Education  Engineering  Future of Innovation in Society  Graduate  Health Solutions  Honors  Journalism  Law  Nursing and Health  Public Service and Community Solutions  Sustainability  University College  Thunderbird School of Global Management     Map & Locations   Map  Tempe  West  Polytechnic  Downtown Phoenix  Online and Extended  Lake Havasu  Skysong  Research Park  Washington D.C.
