Wilfredo Marrero holds a B.A. degree in computer science and mathematics from Columbia University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.  He began teaching computer science at DePaul University in 1999.  His research interests span the broad area of formal methods, especially how they can be applied to computer security.  He has worked on hardware verification while spending summers at Intel and at Cadence Berkeley Labs.  He developed a model checker called Brutus that can be used to analyze security protocols as well as a validity checker for the temporal logic CTL.  He continues to search for ways to apply formal models, logic, and computer automation to aid in the design of complex hardware, software, and security.
