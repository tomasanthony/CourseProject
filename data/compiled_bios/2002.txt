 Hubert Chan Department of Computer Science Chow Yei Ching Building The University of Hong Kong Pokfulam Road Hong Kong Email: loginID(my first name) at cs.hku.hk I am an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong. My main research interests are algorithms, combinatorial optimization, discrete metric space, security & privacy. I have defended my PhD thesis in September 2007 under the supervision of my advisor Anupam Gupta at Carnegie Mellon University. From 2007 to 2009, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut fr Informatik.
