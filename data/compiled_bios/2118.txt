Previously, I was a member of the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory . Before that, I was a Lecturer at the University of Michigan , where I taught courses on Security and Programming. Between 2013 and 2015, I was a Postdoc working with Todd Austin (Architecture) and Kevin Fu (Security) at the University of Michigan . In May of 2013, I earned a PhD in Computer Science (advised by Sam King ) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign , where I also earned my Masters in 2008. I earned my BS in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida in May 2006. Broadly, I am interested in systems, security, and architecture. My current research spans hardware and embedded system security, intermittently powered systems, and approximate computing. Previous research projects include, crafting and detecting malicious insertions into hardware and hardware support for real-time and embedded systems. Copyright 2017, Matthew Hicks.
