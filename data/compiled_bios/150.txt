Recent News: In 2017, I supported and promoted the idea of offering a night exam during the month of Ramadan for Muslim students while making the accommodation available to all students. This initiative was originally proposed by UWB biology professor Bryan White. The idea received extensive local, national, and international media coverage. This resulted in a change of policy at UW-Bothell to adopt this accommodation to become mandatory as of 2018. You can read more about this story in Seattle Times and PJ Media
