 if !vml endif CHENG Ho- lun , Alan B.Sc. ( CUHK ), M.Phil. ( HKUST ), Ph.D. ( UIUC ) Alan, CHENG Ho- lun was born in Hong Kong . He completed his Bachelor's degree in computer science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and M.Phil. in computer science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology . He then began his doctoral work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , completing a Ph.D. in computer science in May 2002, with thesis titled " Algorithms for Smooth and Deformable Surfaces in 3D " ( pdf ) under the supervision of Prof. Herbert Edelsbrunner . (Thus, my Erdos number is 3 and here is my mathematical genealogy .) Ho- lun's interests include computational geometry, parametric surfaces, computer graphics, visualization . He was a teaching assistant during his master degree and received the Best Teaching Assistant Award in 1996 at HKUST. During the Ph.D. years, he was a visiting scholar in the BioGeometry Center in Duke University .
