Nianwen Xue is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department and the Language & Linguistics Program at Brandeis University. Before joining Brandeis, Nianwen Xue was a research assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for Computational Language and Education Research (CLEAR) at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science and the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He got his PhD in linguistics from University of Delaware.Nianwen Xue has broad interests in computational linguistics and natural language processing. He has devoted substantial efforts to the development of linguistic corpora annotated with syntactic, semantic, temporal and discourse information that are crucial resources in the field of natural language processing. The other thread of his research involves using statistical and machine learning techniques in solving natural language processing problems. He has published work in the areas of Chinese word segmentation, syntactic and semantic parsing, coreference, discourse analysis, machine translation as well as biomedical natural language processing. His research has received support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), IARPA and DARPA. He serves on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Asian Language Processing, Language Resources and Evaluation, and Computer Processing of Oriental Languages.
