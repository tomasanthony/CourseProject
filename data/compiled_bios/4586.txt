 Patrick Crowley Professor Lab Website Research While PatrickCrowley's interests span several areas at the intersection of computer architecture and networking systems, his current research projects focus on the design and implementation of scalable networking systems and security. The Applied Research Laboratory also operates multiple public networking research testbeds, including theOpen Network Lab and the Global NDN Testbed. Biography Professor Crowley is director of the Applied Research Laboratory. His research career began at the University of Washington where he earned a PhD in Computer Science & Engineering for his work in the design and evaluation of processor and memory architectures for high-performance networking, a line of research that predated and subsequently influenced the development of commercial network processors. Professor Crowley is founder and Chief Technology Officer of Observable Networks , which has commercialized his endpoint modeling technology. He is co-editor of the three-book series, Network Processor Design and co-founded the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), a premier research conference in the area of high-speed networking systems. In 2007, Professor Crowley was chosen to join the DARPA Computer Science Study Group.: . . . 314-935-9186 pcrowley@wustl.edu JolleyHall, Room 215. . Google Scholar. .
