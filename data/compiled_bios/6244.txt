Cristiana Amza Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Computer Engineering Research Group University of Toronto 10 King's College Rd. Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4 Cristiana Amza received the B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from Bucharest Polytechnic Institute in 1991, the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Rice University in 1997 and 2003 respectively. Her research interests are in the design, implementation and evaluation of distributed systems. Her current work focuses on scaling and consistency issues in web server technologies and distributed databases. Her current research project, Chorus on the Cloud studies infrastructure design for Cloud environments that can automatically adapt to a changing environment and workload through self-managing, self-tuning and self-healing. The project goal is to provide ease of use, scalability, high availability and differentiated quality-of-service for a range of dynamic content services such as e-commerce, on-line bidding, neuroscience modeling and massively multiplayer games. In the past, she has worked on algorithms for data replication in persistent memory clusters, and reducing the overhead of consistency maintenance for Software Distributed Shared Memory systems. Research Interests Adaptive and reconfigurable distributed systems, distributed database systems, Web server technologies, parallel and distributed computing. Active Research Projects Chorus on the Cloud Software Transactional Memory Publications Note for U of T grad students Any of my research directions could become either a Masters or Ph.D project for interested students enrolled at U of T in either the ECE or CS Departments. I'm also open to any student initiated project in the general area of distributed systems and/or web servers.
