La Jolla, CA 92093-5004, USA Phone: (858) 822-2577. Fax: (858) 534-7029 E-mail: daniele(at)cs.ucsd.edu I am a professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of California, San Diego . I am a member of the Cryptography and Security group and the Theory of Computation group. My research interests include: Algorithms, Complexity and cryptographic applications of lattice and coding problems Symbolic analysis of cryptographic protocols (formal methods for computer and network security) Many other topics in cryptography (e.g., zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives with special properties) See research projects and publications web pages for more information about my research. If you want to know more about lattices and their cryptographic applications, take course CSE206A: Lattice Algorithms and Applications (usually offered every two or three years) or read my book Complexity of lattice problems: a cryptographic perspective .
