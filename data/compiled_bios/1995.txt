 Degrees PhD, Computer Science, University of Maryland College Park MS, Mathematics, Cornell University BS, Mathematics, Villanova University Languages Spoken Chinese Bio Angela Wu received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1978. From 1978 to 1980, she was an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. In 1980 she joined the faculty of American University as an Associate Professor and became a Full Professor in 1985. Her research and publications cover a wide range of areas including computer vision, parallel algorithms and computational geometry. She is particularly interested in algorithms and data structures for geometric problems with applications in image processing and pattern recognition. In 1993, Dr. Wu co-founded the Annual Vision Geometry Conference to promote the use of geometric techniques in computer vision, and she served as Conference Chair for 15 years. Since 1998, Dr. Wu has been on the Executive Council of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the International Honor Society for Computing Sciences. She was International President of Upsilon Pi Epsilon in 2008. :
