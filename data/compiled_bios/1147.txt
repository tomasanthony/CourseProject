Before that I was a postdoctoral research associate with the Physical and Biological Computing group at Rice University . I graduated from the Department of Computer Science in Tel Aviv University , Israel, where I was a member of the structural bioinformatics group . Research Interests My research lies in the areas of computational structural biology and structural bioinformatics. My goal is to better understand the structure and flexibility of proteins, to model conformational changes in proteins, and to design novel nano-structures which may contribute to the understanding of the self-assembly properties of proteins and facilitate experimental nano-design. In my research, I focus on both the development of novel algorithms and the application of state-of-the-art existing methodologies to various problems in molecular biology, nanobiology and biochemistry. A detailed (albeit not always updated...) description of my past and present research can be found here . Teaching I am on sabbatical leave at Boston University in Spring 2017. Past courses Advanced data structures and algorithms ( CS310 ), since Fall 2009 Analysis of algorithms ( CS624 , Spring 2010, 2012, 2015, Fall 2015) Algorithms in Bioinformatics ( CS612 , Spring 2010, 2012, 2014.) Science gateway seminar( CS187/188 , Fall 2013-Spring 2014.) Announcements I am the general co-chair for ACM-BCB 2017 , which will take place in August 2017 in Boston. A paper co-authored by Dong Luo was accepted to IEEE-ICCABS 2016 and was selected for an extended journal version. A paper co-authored by Roshanak Farhoodi was accepted to IEEE-ICCABS 2016 Amir Vajdi's paper was accepted to BICoB 2016 . Bahar Akbal-Delibas' paper, co-authored with Marc Pomplun , was accepted to BICoB 2015 . An extended version of the paper, co authored with Roshanak Farhoodi, appeared in the Journal of Computational Biology Congratulations to Dr. Bahar Akbal-Delibas for a successful thesis defense!
