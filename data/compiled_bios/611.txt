From 1993 until August 2001, he worked for Motorola, Inc. in Austin, TX, where he was the manager of the High Performance Design Technology group. Since August 2001, he has been on the faculty at the University of Michigan as a full Professor. His work has focused on VLSI design with particular emphasis on ultra-low power design, millimeter scale sensor nodes, high performance accelerators for cognitive and image processing and adaptive design. He has published over 550 papers and holds 60 patents. He is an IEEE fellow and a member of the IEEE International Solid-State Circuit Conference (ISSCC) technical program committee. Millimeter Sensor Design and Mixed-Signal and RF Circuits One area of Blaauws most recent work has focused on ultra-low power sensor systems for the Internet of Things (IoT). By reducing the average power consumption of sensor electronics from uW to the nW range, his team has made it possible to reduce the size of the battery and energy harvesting to only a couple millimeters. Combined with their new techniques for radio communication with mm-scale antennae [1, 2] and DC-DC conversion using only on-chip components [3, 4], they have been able to construct the first complete and functional millimeter-scale sensor node systems. Their first system was an intra-ocular pressure sensor measuring only ~1mm on the side, created in 2011 [5]. Since that time, they have expanded their systems to incorporated a commercial ARM Cortex M0 processor with low leakage memory [13], ultra-low power flash [6] and a number of different sensing modalities, including imaging [7], audio [8], pressure [10], ECG[11] and temperature [12] sensing. These systems typically measure a couple millimeters in size, are fully programmable with processor and memory, operate for several weeks on the integrated battery alone and become energy autonomous with energy harvesting [14]. The teams work is currently featured at the Computer History Museum in California as the worlds smallest computer. This research required that all parts of a computing system be re-architected, including voltage regulation (DC-DC conversion) [3, 15], harvesting [4], timers[16], references [17], analog front ends such as analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) [38], capacitance-to-digital conversion (CDC) [18], imaging [7], audio [9], RF design [1, 2] and even low leakage ESD pads [19]. They have found that the application space of such millimeter computing systems is practically unlimited. They are currently working actively with other researchers to deploy their sensors for butterfly tracking, down-hole oil-reservoir exploration and medical implantable applications as well as commercializing the technology. High Performance Accelerators for Image Processing and Deep Learning In the area of high performance computing, Blaauws recent work has focused on hardware acceleration for image processing [20, 39] and deep learning/neural networks [21]. A particularly interesting approach his team has been pursuing of late is the use of so-called in memory computing or bit-line computing where calculations are performed directly on the bit lines in the SRAM itself [22, 23, 24]. This avoids the need to move data from memories to compute units/cores, thereby greatly reducing power consumption while opening up enormous parallelism presented by the large number of memory arrays in a processor. Low Power and Subthreshold Design Blaauw has had a long research agenda in low power design. He introduced the concept of the energy optimal voltage (Vopt) in 2004 (DAC) [25] together with his student Bo Zhai and colleague Dennis Sylvester. At Vopt voltage, the energy per operation reaches a minimum, and further reduction of the supply voltage increases the leakage energy more quickly than the dynamic energy reduces. Their paper was the first to formulate analytical expressions for the value of Vopt and explore its dependence on circuit switching activity and process parameters. Typically, Vopt lies below the threshold voltage, leading to the need for subthreshold design. Blaauw and Sylvesters research team spent the following years developing ultra-low power sensor systems using subthreshold design. This led to numerous publications, including new, ultra-low voltage SRAM designs [26, 27], subthreshold processor architectures [28, 29] and signal processing using super pipelining to further reduce the Vopt point.[30] Near-Threshold Design for Throughput Limited Computing In addition, Blaauw applied these low power techniques to throughput limited, high-performance computing found in data centers. Together with Professors Mudge and Sylvester, they were the first to introduced the concept of near threshold computing (NTC) in 2007 (ISLPED) [31]. For throughput constrained, parallelizable applications, NTC operates at the optimal trade-off between the energy efficiency gained through low voltage operation and performance gain from operating at a higher voltage. Their papers found that for parallelizable workloads, the optimal point occurs at a supply voltage that is ~200mV above the threshold voltage of the technology (i.e., near the threshold voltage) [40, 41]. This approach has been widely adopted in the industry (e.g., Intels NTV) and has led to new investigations by Blaauws research team into low voltage design for chip multiprocessors, including novel high radix routers to connect chip multiprocessors with memory [32] and investigation into 3D multiprocessor designs [33]. Adaptive Design and Razor Techniques In the area of adaptive design, Blaauw introduced a new approach called Razor in 2003 (MICRO) [34] where processor chips automatically tune their frequency or supply voltage to the point of failure, thereby eliminating wasteful design margins. By adding low-overhead delay error detection and correction circuits, Razor automatically tunes the processor to operate at the point where failures start to occur (which subsequently are automatically corrected), indicating that all margins are removed. As the chip experiences different environmental conditions, such as temperature and supply voltage changes or aging effects, Razor automatically tracks the innate performance of the design by maintaining a low error rate. Razor was implemented in several test chips, showing as much as 50% power reduction and 30% performance improvement [35, 42, 43, 44] . It spawned significant additional research in related approaches by industry and academic researchers, and the key papers [34, 35, 36, 37] have been referenced over 2,000 times. In addition, Blaauw has investigated other areas of adaptive design, such as methods for in situ detection and management of aging based oxide-breakdown and NBTI degradation [45, 46].
