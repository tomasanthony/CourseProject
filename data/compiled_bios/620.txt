Corso is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Johns Hopkins University in 2005. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award (2009), ARO Young Investigator award (2010), Google Faculty Research Award (2015) and on the DARPA CSSG. His main research thrust is high-level computer vision and its relationship to human language, robotics and data science. He primarily focuses on problems in video understanding such as video segmentation, activity recognition, and video-to-text. From biomedicine to recreational video, imaging data is ubiquitous. Yet, imaging scientists and intelligence analysts are without an adequate language and set of tools to fully tap the information-rich image and video. He works to provide such a language; specifically, he primarily studies the coupled problems of segmentation and recognition from a Bayesian perspective emphasizing the role of statistical models in efficient visual inference. His long-term goal is a comprehensive and robust methodology of automatically mining, quantifying, and generalizing information in large sets of projective and volumetric images and video.
