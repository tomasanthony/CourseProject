What We Do   About CUbiC  Most ubiquitous computing research takes a technology-centric view in solving real world problems. It is our belief that a balanced technology and problem-centric view is required in tackling challenging application domains. We also believe that by targeting applications that require ubiquitous computing solutions, in contrast to applications with a ubiquitous computing flavor, brings out the underlying challenges that need to be addressed. In keeping with this spirit, we have chosen to serve the needs of physically challenged individuals by empowering them with ubiquitous and pervasive computing technologies to enrich their lives. Motivated by this approach, we have assembled focus groups of blind and deaf individuals and researchers involved in disability studies and mobility instructors to bring out the real needs in this application. These inputs have served to shape our research agenda in the various facets of ubiquitous computing.                    News         CUbiC Undergrad Shubham Mehta Wins First at Sunhacks 2018    Shubham Mehta, an Undergraduate researcher who works in Cubic, won the first prize for the student assistive chrome extension in the Sunhacks 2018 Hackathon with his team. The Sunhacks hackathon was a competition between various programmers to put out the best solution or product in 48 hours. Shubham and his team used JavaScript to develop a solution where a student can type in a homework problem and the program returns a solved solution by searching the internet. The program works by using the site Textsheet.com which modifies the blurred answer provided by for-profit sites such as Chegg. It does so by getting the token number of the question and then the solution image then, the image appears on the screen. Shubham and his team wanted to allow students to have access to high-quality homework help without paying anything extra aside from the already required classroom materials. The team won the first place out of all other projects at the hackathon.    read more            Events    Center Director  Sethuraman Panchanathan  research.asu.edu      WANT THE LATEST CUbiC NEWS?
