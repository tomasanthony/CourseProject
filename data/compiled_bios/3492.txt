 Shahriar Nirjon Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Email: nirjon@cs,unc,edu HOME PUBLICATION RESEARCH IMPACT Research Interest I am interested in Embedded Intelligence the general idea of which is to make resource constrained embedded systems capable of sensing, learning, adapting, and evolving. In recent past, I have worked on Networked Embedded Sensor Systems (HW/SW Co-Design and Wearables), Wireless Networks and Sensing (Mobile, WSN, and other RF), Mobile Systems (OS, Services, and Applications), , and Internet of Things (IoT devices, privacy, data analytics, and mobile Health). Before joining the UNC Chapel Hill as an Assistant Professor (2015), I was a researcher in the Networking and Mobility Lab at the HP Labs (2014-2015). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, under the supervision of Jack Stankovic (August 2014).
