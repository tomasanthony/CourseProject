 Foteini Baldimtsi teaching Cryptography CS 795 ISA 656 ISA656 isa656_s18 Sitemap Foteini Baldimtsi I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University . My research interests are in cryptography, security and data privacy with a special focus in electronic cash, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies and private authentication techniques. My research is supported by NSF and an IBM faculty award. I received my Ph.D. from Brown University in May 2014 where I was supervised by Anna Lysyanskaya. During my time at Brown I was fortunate to spent a semester at Microsoft Research in Redmont, WA working in the Cryptography group with Melissa Chase and a summer at IBM Research in Zurich working as a member of the Cryptography and Security group . From 2014 to 2016 I was a postdoctoral researcher in the BU Security group at Boston University and also had a research affiliation with the Crypto.Sec group at University of Athens .
