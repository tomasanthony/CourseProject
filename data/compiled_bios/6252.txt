As part of building things, I like to think about how to do it right, especially as the complexity of the world increases. I have particular interests in computer architecture focusing on building fast microprocessors and application-specific processors using FPGAs. Some of the chip building actually gets done in my VLSI Systems Design course. Grad Studies: What, Why, Where, How Some things you might want to know. Courses About past and present courses.
