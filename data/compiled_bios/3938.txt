Honors and Awards Young Faculty Award, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 2009 ME Achievement Award, University of Michigan Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2008 Faculty Type Tenured and Tenure-Track Related News Improving Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion in Polymers 09/24/2017 In collaboration with MSE Professor Jinsang Kims group, ME Professor Kevin Pipes lab is using molecular design principles to improve thermal conductivity in polymers. Pipe's research featured on phys.org and Engadget 08/03/2017 Professor Pipe and a team of U-M researchers have found a way to change plastic's molecular structure, making it as thermallyconductiveas glass U-M engineering researchers develop heat-conducting plastic 12/08/2014 The spaghetti-like internal structure of most plastics makes it hard for them to cast away heat, but a U-M research team, including ME associate professor Kevin Pipe, has made a plastic blend that does so 10 times better than its conventional counterparts Kevin Pipes Research Reaches Front Page of Wired 08/27/2013 On August 23rd, the magazine dedicated its front-page story to an article discussing the groups solution to the overheating of microprocessors in smartphones and tablets. Improving materials that convert heat to electricity and vice-versa 05/08/2013 Pipe's research team has found a way to nearly double the efficiency of a particular class of them that's made with organic semiconductors U-M to host 14th PHONONS conference 07/03/2012 The 14th International Conference on Phonon Scattering in Condensed Matter will be held at the Michigan League on the University of Michigan campus during July 8-12 Pagination Next page Mechanical Engineering Homepage G.G.
