Potential topics for senior seminar I am interested in any topic related to programming languages, software design, and compilers research, as well as topics in cryptography and its applications and in computational linguistics. Other topics are fine as well. Below are some random ideas: Java decompilation: restoring Java source code from byte code. This topic is a nice combination of technical research and discussion of ethical issues (protection of intellectual property). Incorporating program performance considerations into a software development cycle, specifically into agile development. My schedule on UMM Google calendar . A bit of history... I am originally from Moscow, Russia. I spent many years in Boston . I received my Ph.D. at Boston University in Spring 2002. From Fall 2001 till Spring 2003 I taught at Computer Science Department at Wellesley College . Click here to see my web page at Wellesley.
