I have a MA from Cambridge, a PhD in Complex Systems and Non Linear Dynamics (School of Informatics, dept of Engineering of the University of Firenze , Italy) and a PhD in (Theoretical) Genetics ( University of Pavia , Italy). Other Affliations: I am member of - the Integrate Cancer Medicine Institute , the committee of MPhil in Computational Biology (Stakeholder Group for the CCBI) , steering committee of Cambridge BIG data , VPH-UK (Virtual Physiologycal Human), Fellow of Clare Hall College . I am Listed in www.topitalianscientists.org/Top_italian_scientists_VIA-Academy.aspx Dept Administrative duties: reviewer in University of Cambridge complaint and review procedure committee; others: External Examiner at the University of Newcastle for the MSc Bioinformatics, MSc Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics, MSc Computational Systems Biology. I have successfully completed the equality and diversity essentials. My research interest focuses on using bioinformatics, computational biology models and machine learning to integrate various types of data (molecular and clinical, drugs, social and lifestyle) across different spatial and temporal scales of biological complexity to address personalised and precision medicine. In the context of basic science, these approaches are effective in understanding the mechanisms and the dynamics of how biological elements build up properties such as sensing the environment, information carrying, being programmable and doing computation and communication. In the context of biomedical fields, by integrating different layers of evidences, predictive models will improve the accuracy of diagnosis of complex diseases in presence of other chronic and acute conditions, will identify effective markers for disease trajectory and suggest composition of treatments (drugs and lifestyle) before the manifestation of symptoms. I am happy to receive enquiries for PhD applications.
