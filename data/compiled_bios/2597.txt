Data Analytics Department of Computer and Information Science Lowenstein, LL610-E 113 W 60th St., New York NY 10023 Email: yzhao11 (at) fordham.edu Dr. Zhao's homepage Biography Dr. Yijun Zhao is an assistant professor of Computer and Information Science at Fordham University. She received her MS and BS degrees in Computer Science from the University of Kansas and Tianjin University, respectively. Dr. Zhao earned her PhD degree in Computer Science from Tufts University for her research in addressing bias and subjectivity in Machine Learning. Prior to embarking on her academic career, Dr. Zhao worked in the financial industry for over 10 years in a wide variety of roles, including a consultant at PricewaterCoopers, a senior quantitative analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors, and a quantitative trader at hedge funds Millennium Partners and Ronin Capital Research Interests The success of supervised machine learning algorithms rests on the assumption that data are drawn from the same underlying distribution. However, this assumption is often violated in real world applications where collected data involves human judgement. Dr. Zhaos research focuses on investigating machine learning methods that can be used to enhance performance while learning with datasets containing bias and human subjectivity. In collaboration with leading experts from Harvard Medical School and NYU's Langone Medical Center, Dr. Zhao has applied Machine Learning methods to predict disease course in Multiple Sclerosis patients and detect brain abnormalities occurring in neurological disorders such as Epilepsy.
