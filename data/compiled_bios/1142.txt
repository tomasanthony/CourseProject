Email Software Tiago is an assistant professor at UMass Boston. Tiago's research helps programmers write software with fewer bugs. Tiago develops tools that localize errors, proves the correctness of algorithms, and mines how we write code to identify anomalies. Tiago is looking for self-motivated students who are interested in improving the quality of our software.
