My research interests are in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, where I am best know for research on Description Logics, which are today the foundation of Web Ontology Languages, and Ontology-Based Data Access. I have applied KRR techniques to Databases and Software Requirements and Specification. In turn, these raised KRR issues that led me to new problems.I obtained my PhD in theoretical computational linguistics from the University of Toronto, where my supervisor was C. Raymond Perrault. I travelled around the world for a year, and then switched to work on something more applied: conceptual modeling based on KR languages.
