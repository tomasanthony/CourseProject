 Scott Beamer Assistant Professor Computer Science and Engineering University of California, Santa Cruz sbeamer@ucsc.edu Office: Engineering 2 Room 229 I design architectures for data-intensive applications, with a focus on improving communication efficiency. I am interested in: computer architecture, data movement optimization, memory interconnects, open-source hardware design, and graph algorithms. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley while working on the GAP Project . Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in the Computer Architecture Group . Want to learn to leverage domain insights to create blazing fast software and efficient architectures? I am currently seeking motivated and curious graduate students. If interested, please contact me and apply to UC Santa Cruz! Teaching Winter 2019 - CMPE293: Programmable Hardware Accelerators Spring 2019 - CMPE202: Computer Architecture Research My research focuses on improving communication efficiency, since for many data-intensive workloads, accessing the necessary data (communication) is often a bigger challenge than the computation itself. For these communication-bound workloads, optimizing communication can bring many benefits, whether it be improved performance, decreased energy consumption, or reduced manufacturing cost. Much of my work focusses on graph processing, as its data-intensive nature exposes many communication challenges. Going forward, I'm excited to bring my approach to other computational patterns and application domains. To improve communication efficiency, one can either reduce the amount of communication (move less data) or accelerate the rate of communication (increase utilized bandwidth). My research utilizes both approaches, and I apply them by optimizing software or designing new hardware. To guide these optimization efforts, I analyze the workload to identify bottlenecks. To more aggressively improve hardware communication efficiency, I also investigate the best ways to leverage new technologies such as monolithically integrated silicon photonics.
