In 2008 its authors introduced a new version of the language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2, initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. Method: We have developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have assembled a large corpus of Python applications. We use PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption.

Computer programming requires both practice and instruction, and this skill cannot be acquired simply by reading a textbook or copying code found on the internet. The Code project provides a web interface that contains sets of graduated exercises that are evaluated for quality and correctness.
