She was previously Dwight C. and Hildagarde E. Baum Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering from 2015-2018 and is an inaugural holder of a Gabilan Distinguished Professorship in Science and Engineering.   She received the B.S. degree in engineering and applied science and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, in 1997, 1998, and 2003, respectively.  Her research interests include biomedical microelectromechanical systems (bioMEMS), implantable biomedical microdevices, microfluidics, multimodality integrated microsystems, microsensors and actuators, biocompatible polymer microfabrication, and packaging. Dr. Meng is a member of Tau Beta Pi, the Biomedical Engineering Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the American Society for Engineering Education. Her honors include the NSF CAREER award, Wallace H. Coulter Foundation Early Career Award, 2009 TR35 Young Innovator Under 35, Viterbi Early Career Chair, ASEE Curtis W. McGraw Research Award, and 2018 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Technical Achievement Award.   She is a fellow of IEEE, ASME, BMES, and AIMBE. She is on the editorial board of the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering and Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering, Micro- and Nano-mechanical Systems. She was co-chair of the 2017 IEEE MEMS conference. She is also an active educator and authored a textbook on bioMEMS.Research SummaryThe Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory at USC focuses on developing novel micro- and nanotechnologies for biomedical applications. In particular, we are interested in the integration of multiple modalities (e.g. electrical, mechanical, and chemical) in miniaturized devices measuring no more than a few millimeters for use in fundamental scientific research, biomedical diagnostics, and therapy.Awards2013 American Society for Engineering Education 2014 ASEE Engineering Research Council's Curtis W.
