Philipp Kornreich Professor Emeritus Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 3-125 CST 315.443.4438 [email&#160;protected] Degree(s): Ph. D. Phone #: 315-443-4447 Office for Instructional Matters 315-443-9712 Fiber Fabrication Research Laboratory Research Interests: Optics Vision Lasers Nuclear Fusion Astrophysics Current Research: My current research explores the possibility of three dimensional vision with a single eye or camera. It is possible to construct a camera that measures the distance from each pixel to the point on the object that is in focus at the pixel. We are also investigating if humans can see in three dimensions with one eye. Other current work includes the study of fibers with various coatings at the core cladding boundary. I am also investigating the theory associated with nuclear laser fusion using femto second scale deterministic ion motion in a LiD crystal rather than random motion in a plasma. Lately I have also done some work on an information theory based mode of the Cosmic Background Radiation.
