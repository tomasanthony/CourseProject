Gokarna P. SharmaResearch Interests: Parallel and Distributed Computing; Multicore Computing; Sensor Networks; Emerging Technologies; Distributed Robotics; Graph TheoryResearch Summary: Dr. Sharma's research focus is broadly in the area of parallel and distributed computing. He has worked heavily in the past in transactional memory, a new synchronization technique for multicore architectures that avoids many limitations of traditional lock-based synchronization techniques. He has also worked on distributed sensor networks where the focus was on handling problems arise from mobility. Most recently the focus of his research is on the investigation of emerging technologies such as Internet of Things and distributed robotics, besides his continuing research on transactional memory and sensor networks.
