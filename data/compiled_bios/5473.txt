Alyssa B. Apsel Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 229 607/255-3962 Dir Acad College of Engineering aba25@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography Alyssa Apsel received the B.S. from Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, in 1995 and the Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2002. She joined Cornell University in 2002, where she is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. She is also a Visiting Professor at Imperial College in London working on RF interfaces for implantable electronics. Apsel became the Director of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell in July 2018. She has authored or coauthored over 100 refereed publications in related fields of RF mixed signal circuit design, ultra-low power radio, photonic integration with VLSI, and circuit design techniques in the presence of variation resulting in five patents and several pending patent applications.Apsel is alsoa Distinguished Lecturer for IEEE CAS Society for 2018-2019.. Research Interests The focus of Apsel's research is on power-aware mixed signal circuits and design for highly scaled CMOS and modern electronic systems. Her current focus is on low power radio for IoT and reconfigurable multi-standard radio to extend the reach of wireless communications. Her research group investigates new approaches to cost-effective designs that leverage today's technology but achieve improved performance per unit power. She looks at how problems resulting from device scaling such as process variation, noise and reduced analog performance can be addressed with skillful analog and mixed signal design.
