 Pamela Cosman Professor Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty Equity Adviser Jacobs School of Engineering University of California, San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive, Mail Code 0407 La Jolla, CA 92093-0407 I am Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego . I joined UCSD in July of 1995. Prior to that, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, and a postdoctoral fellow and lecturer in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1993 and my B.S.E.E. from the California Institute of Technology in 1987. At UCSD, I was the Director of the Center for Wireless Communications from 2006 to 2008, and the Associate Dean for Students of the Jacobs School of Engineering from 2013 to 2016. I am also affiliated with the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. I do research on image and video compression, wireless communications, and image and video processing. This is my first children's book. It's for ages 9 to 12. It teaches a little bit about error correction coding and other concepts in wireless communications through a fictional story. Kids are passing secret messages in school, which gets them in trouble at school when someone changes one bit in the message. But when there's a hostage crisis in a bank, the error correction code ends up playing an unexpected role. Check out some reviews of the book at the: American Society for Engineering Education Corporate blog of Keysight Technologies Blog of editor/writer Sarah Monsma . The book is available from Amazon and from the UCSD bookstore .
