 Yue Cheng Assistant Professor @ GMU Home Publications Research Teaching Contact Me [excel] About Me I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at George Mason University . I am broadly interested in computer systems. My research covers a range of topics including distributed systems, storage systems, container-based virtualization, serverless/cloud computing, and the internet of things. Currently I am working on a few exciting projects including: (1) optimizing serverless platform; (2) exploiting NVM in HPC; (3) large-scale cluster (container) scheduling; and (4) systems support for distributed machine learning. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I worked with Ali R. Butt . During my Ph.D. I spent two summers at IBM Research Almaden in 2013 and 2014, and six months at Dell EMC Princeton Office in 2015. Research Openings Details I am currently looking for motivated students to work with me on systems research. If you are a Mason student who is interested in doing systems research, please come talk to me. For students outside Mason, I encourage you to apply to our graduate program.
