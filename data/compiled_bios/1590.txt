 Jun Yang Professor Department of Computer Science Duke University Home Publications Students Teaching Personal I am a Professor of Computer Science at Duke University. My primary research interest lies in the area of database and data-intensive computing. I received my M.S., Ph.D. from Stanford University and B.A. from University of California, Berkeley. Here is my curriculum vitae . I co-direct the Duke Database Research Group , which is part of the Duke Systems and Architecture Group. My research has been supported by National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Duke University, Google, HP, and IBM. More details about my research projects can be found on my research group page . Here are some of my current and recent projects: Computational Journalism : using computing to help preserving public interest journalism (collaboration with Duke School of Public Policy). Perturbation Analysis of Database Queries : studying how perturbations of the query form and parameters affect the query result, with applications such as computational fact-checking and lead-finding. Cumulon : simplifying the development and deployment of statistical analysis programs in the cloud with automatic optimization and provisioning. RIOT : transparently bringing scalability and I/O-efficiency to statistical computing with R ; i.e., no need to rewrite your R code! 2009-2014. ProSem : Internet-scale publish/subscribe unifying data processing and dissemination. 2007-2011. DDDAS: dynamic data-driven environmental sensor network in Duke Forest (collaboration with Duke School of the Environment). 2006-2012. ERS: tracking and exploring lineage in experimental and computational workflows for biomedical research (collaboration with Duke Center for Computational Immunology). 2005-2011. DDM : techniques and applications of maintaining various forms of derived data (e.g., caches, replicas, indexes, materialized views, synopses). 2001-2008.
