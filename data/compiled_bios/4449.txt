I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Boston University Questrom School of Business and a Junior Faculty Fellow of the Hariri Institute. Previously, I was a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University working with Joan Feigenbaum, and an Affiliate at the Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS) at Harvard University. I completed my PhD in 2011 in Computer Science at Boston University under the supervision of John Byers and Michael Mitzenmacher (from Harvard). I am broadly interested in problems lying in the intersection of marketing, computer science, and economics, and a lot of my work has focused on large scale empirical studies of internet markets.
