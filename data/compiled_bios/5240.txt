 Research Interests Information Retrieval Machine Learning Algorithms Education PhD, Northeastern University Biography Dr. Virgil Pavlu obtained his PhD in 2008 on Information Retrieval Measures and Evaluation. Dr. Pavlu has several research interests in information retrieval: diversity, learning to rank, metasearch, score distribution models, relevance feedback, etc. Since 2007, he is involved with the SIGIR conference either as a reviewer or an organizer; he was a coordinator of several TREC and NTCIR tracks. Dr. Pavlus current research centers around machine learning algorithms for certain data types, and, in particular, applications to text data: on long text, the extraction and selection of n-grams features; on short text, the discovery, indexing and matching of nuggets for tasks like relevance and novelty. One of his projects addresses the representability of text documents in high dimensional spaces, the study of similarity and distance notions, and the active learning application to crowdsourcing methodologies for obtaining such representation. Hometown Bucharest, Romania Field of research/teaching Data Science What is your educational background? Mathematics was my only field of study until I decided I wanted something more applied. What is your research focus? The research we do evolves with both data collected by different organizations, and with the computational infrastructure available. Sometimes we are problem solvers in a practical sense. What courses/subjects do you teach? Machine Learning Information Retrieval Algorithms :
