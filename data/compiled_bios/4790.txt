 Arpita Ghosh Associate Professor Dept. of Information Science Cornell University I received my B.Tech from IIT Bombay in 2001, and my PhD from Stanford in 2006. I spent the next 6 years (2006-2012) in the Microeconomics and Social Sciences group at Yahoo! Research. In August 2012, I moved to Cornell as an Associate Professor of Information Science in the School of Computing and Information Science. I received tenure in June 2016. My research focuses on using mathematical analysis to inform the design of online systems. I am interested in the analysis and design of online user contribution economies---both explicit, as in crowdsourcing and user-generated content platforms, or implicit, as in the collection of data from privacy-aware users---within a mathematical framework, with a particular focus on incentive design. I am currently most excited about the idea of `behavioral' mechanism design, exploring how departures from the classical economic models of agent behavior can impact optimal design. Some representative papers: 'Behavioral' Mechanism Design: Behavioral Mechanism Design: Optimal Crowdsourcing Contracts and Prospect Theory . Joint with David Easley. ACM EC 2015. ( Short overview version : SigEcom Exchanges Vol 14.1, June 2015) How does the optimal contract structure in crowdsourcing markets change if workers make decisions according to prospect theory preferences [Kahneman and Tversky 1979] rather than classical expected utility theory? Optimal contests for simple agents . Joint with Robert Kleinberg. ACM EC 2014 (Journal version: ACM TEAC, 2016, forthcoming). Users in many online contribution settings are `simple`---they make strategic choices about participation, but not about effort. What does this mean for incentive design? Incentives in online user contribution: Incentives, gamification, and game theory: An economic approach to badge design . Joint with David Easley. ACM EC 2013. (Journal version: AMC TEAC, 2016, forthcoming). The design of badges on social media platforms, typically the domain of HCI, can be informed by economic analysis: Should badges be awarded for meeting absolute or relative standards? Should a website explicitly display information about the badges other users have won, or not? Incentivizing High-quality User-Generated Content . Joint with Preston McAfee. WWW 2011. User contribution on the Web was treated in the prior literature as a public goods provision problem; this paper introduces the idea that the quality of user-generated content is a response to private benefits from social-psychological rewards. Privacy: Selling Privacy at Auction . Joint with Aaron Roth. ACM EC 2011. (Journal version: GEB 2013) Privacy can be viewed as an economic commodity, measured in units of differential privacy. What might a market for privacy look like? (A complete list of papers, including other papers on these topics, is below .)
