I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2004 with a minor in Mathematics. My Career I am a term assistant professor at George Mason University. I am excited to be teaching introductory programming (CS 1), as well as introductory systems materials to upperclassmen. Soon I will also begin teaching a languages survey course, too, where I believe I would feel most at home with the materials. Research Interests I am interested in language interpretation, type-driven language specifiation, language semantics, type systems, domain specific languages, compilation and systems level design.
