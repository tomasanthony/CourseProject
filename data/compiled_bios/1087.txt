Angela Sasse FREng is the Professor of Human-Centred Security at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. She retains an appointment at UCL but does not take new PhD students. A usability researcher by training, she started investigating the causes and effects of usability issues with security mechanisms in 1996. In addition to studying specific mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, and access control, her research group has developed human-centred frameworks that explain the role of security, privacy, identity and trust in human interactions with technology. She is currently the Director of the multidisciplinary UK Research Institute for Science of Cyber Security (RISCS), funded by EPSRC and GCHQ and now its second phase. The nature and importance of the work was showcased in this Nature article last year. She was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2015, and serves on its Diversity Committee.
