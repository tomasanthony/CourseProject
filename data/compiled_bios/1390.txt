I am hiring new Ph.D. students , graduate/undergraduate interns , and post-doctoral researchers . I am looking for motivated and passionate students to work on exciting research projects! Please contact me if you are interested. About Me I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science , School of Computing at the National University of Singapore . My research interests are in the intersection of sensing systems and security , and focus on utilizing contextual information for security applications in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) . Specifically, my research focuses on enabling cross-platform devices (dissimilar in hardware, vendor, and/or sensor types) to verify relative physical properties and subsequently coordinate across verified devices, hence enabling novel methods of sensor fusion for new security applications. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of Professor Patrick Tague in 2018. I was a member of CMU's Mobile, Embedded, & Wireless Security (MEWS) group and CyLab . I received M.S. and B.S. degrees from the ECE Department at CMU in 2007 and 2006, respectively. S ensing, E mbedded, and N etwork S ecurity G roup ( SENSG) SENSG (pronounced as "sensing") at NUS is directed by Jun Han . The group focuses on various aspects of sensing systems and security/privacy aspects of mobile, embedded, and wireless systems. The group also studies related issues in emerging technologies including drones, electric scooters, truck platooning and other vehicular applications, as well as other IoT and CPS.
