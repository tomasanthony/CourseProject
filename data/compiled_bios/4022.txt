 Alison N. Norman Office: GDC 6.310 Email: ans@cs.utexas.edu Mailing Address: The University of Texas at Austin Computer Science Department 2317 Speedway, Stop D9500 Austin, Texas 78712 I am an Associate Professor of Instruction in The University of Texas at Austin Computer Science Department. I received both my M.S. in computer science and my Ph.D. in computer science from this department. Since then, I have been fortunate enough to spend my days teaching systems to undergraduates and performing outreach to underserved communities. My research interests lie in the intersection of supercomputing and program analysis with a special interest in static techniques to improve checkpointing. I am also interested in large-scale simulation. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech . Here is my undergraduate website.
