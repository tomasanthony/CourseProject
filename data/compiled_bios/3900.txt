 Home Publications Ravi Sethi Professor Office: Gould-Simpson 724 Phone: 520-621-0689 E-mail: rsethi [at] email [dot] arizona [dot] edu Biography I returned to Academia and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona in 2014, after holding senior executive positions at Avaya Labs and Bell Labs. I am a co-author of the "classic definitive compiler technology text" [Wikipedia], popularly known as the "dragon book", and the author of a textbook on programming languages. I have served on Advisory councils for NSF and various universities and on the selection committee for the Turing Award, the highest award in computing (2007-2013). After earning a B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Kanpur and a Ph.D. from Princeton, I was a professor at Penn State (1972-1976). My Bell Labs career (1976-2000) was in the research organization. I was senior vice president for computing and mathematical sciences (1996-1999) and communications sciences (1999-2000). When the parent company, Lucent , spun off its enterprise business, I was named president of Avaya Labs (2000-2014). For my contributions to compilers and programming languages, I was nominated an ACM Fellow (1996); honored as a Distinguished Alumnus (2008) and as one of the top 50 alumni (2010); and selected for the first annual Pan-IIT Technology Leadership Award (2009).
