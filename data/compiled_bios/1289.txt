David Gleich Jyoti and Aditya Mathur Associate Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 2011 EducationPh.D., Stanford University, Computational and Mathematical Engineering (2009) M.S., Stanford University, Computational and Mathematical Engineering (2006) B.S., Harvey Mudd College, Computer Science and Mathematics (2004) Professor Gleich is interested in how we can utilize matrix algebra to express -- and improve -- algorithms in network analysis and data-based simulation analysis. Matrix algebra is a particularly attractive paradigm to study these procedures as it often gives rise to efficient computational procedures in a variety of settings (serial, parallel, streaming). This research straddles a few different areas and often involves working with large datasets on high performance computing architectures (e.g. MPI clusters) and data computing architectures (e.g. MapReduce).
