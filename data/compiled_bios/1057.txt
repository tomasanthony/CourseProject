Note: Whilst every effort is made to keep the syllabus and assessment records correct, the precise details must be checked with the lecturer(s). I am now part-time at UCL and am no longer involved in teaching. I look after some aspects of the CS website, in particular the migration to TYPO3. The best way to contact me is via email . There is extensive online help on using TYPO3. However, TYPO3 has a rich and sometimes baroque range of behaviours so please contact me if things don't seem to work in a useful way. I am stillenjoying a lot of cycling, mainly with the Hertfordshire Wheelers . If you are close to Hertfordshire and fancy joining us for a ride then please get in touch.
