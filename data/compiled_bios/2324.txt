 Ke Yi Associate Professor Postgraduate Programs Coordinator Department of Computer Science and Engineering Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China Office: Room 3547 (via lifts 25, 26) [CV] [Publications] Research Interests Database theory and algorithms; external memory algorithms; parallel and distributed algorithms; sampling; data streams; data summarization; data structures; computational geometry; data mining. Exploiting the rich interdependence between theory and practice is the main theme of my research. I always strive to design algorithms with nice theoretical guarantees that also work well in practice. I like simple algorithms with nontrivial and elegant analyses. I like theories that bring insights to how things should be done in practice (this includes lower bounds!). Systems projects involved: XDB I belong to both the Theoretical Computer Science group and the Database group at HKUST.
