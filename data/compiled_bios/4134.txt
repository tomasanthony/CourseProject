Baishakhi Ray Assistant Professor, Computer Science (by courtesy) Bio B.S. University of Calcutta, India, 2004M.S. University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, 2009Ph.D. University of Texas at Austin, USA, 2013Post-Doc University of California, Davis, USA, 2013-2015 "I focus on improving software quality and the efficiency of the software development process to ensure a sustainable growth of the software industry." Baishakhi Ray, Assistant Professor Baishakhi Ray was an assistant professor at the University of Virginia and now holds a courtesy appointment. She finished her Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. Her research focuses on Software Engineering, in particular, empirical studies and program analysis. Baishakhi analyzes large-scale software repositories to understand on-going software engineering practices. Then, leveraging this data-driven knowledge, she builds novel program analysis techniques and development tools to improve software quality and programmer productivity. Baishakhi has received Distinguished Paper Awards from ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE 2017), International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, (MSR 2017), and best practical student paper awards from 2014 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (Oakland). Her paper was also nominated for the distinguished paper award at IEEE Automatic Software Engineering Conference (ASE), 2013. Her research is also appeared in the "Research Highlights" (RH) section of the CACM and has been widely covered in trade media.
