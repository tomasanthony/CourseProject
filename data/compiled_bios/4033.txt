 Mike Scott's Home Page Greetings! In the spirit of my friend Robert Duvall of Duke University I want to make sure you are in the right place. "Mike Scott" is a very common name . I am not the lead singer of the Waterboys , nor am I the former major league pitcher . I am not this computer scientist . And I am not the fictional character from the television show The Office . I am a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin in the Computer Science Department. I was raised in St. Charles, Missouri. I was an undergraduate at Stanford University receiving a B.S. in Industrial Engineering. I later attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and received a M.S. in Computer Science. Before becoming a full time teacher I spent some time doing something completely different . My office is GDC 6.304 in the north tower, Dell Computer Science Hall How to contact me: Email: scottm@cs.utexas.edu Office phone: (512) 471-9785 (email is preferred) Office Hours for Spring 2019: Monday and Wednesday 1 - 3 pm.
