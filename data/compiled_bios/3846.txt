Some of her highlighted research include (i) treating cancer based on a patients own molecular profile ( Nature Communications 2018 ; Selected by F1000 ), (ii) preventing complications during surgery ( Nature BME 2018 ; Cover article ), (iii) ML theories on explainable AI ( NeurIPS Dec 2017 Full Oral ; Cited 100+times in 2018), and (iv) finding therapeutic targets for Alzheimers disease. More recent projects include (v) predicting kidney diseases, (vi) enabling pre-hospital predictions for trauma patients, and (vii) improving our understanding of pan-cancer biology, (viii) human genome, and (ix) protein folding. Lee Lab is currently collaborating with biomedical researchers and clinicians in UW School of Medicine, Allen Institutes, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, University of British Columbia, etc. News 12/31/2018: Scott's SHAP paper (NeurIPS oral presentation) got cited 100 times as of today after about 1 year it was published. 11/1/2018: Our EMBARKER project on identifying therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease won the Madrona Prize at the Allen School 2018 Industry Affiliates Annual Research Day. Last year , Scott won the same prize on his model interpretation work, SHAP (NIPS oral presentation) and his Nature BME paper featured on the cover (see below).

Prof. Su-In Lee's lab seeks to develop interpretable machine learning techniques to learn from big data: (1) how the human genome or protein works, (2) how to improve healthcare, and (3) how to treat challenging diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Her research page lists her projects, including treating cancer based on a patient's own expression profile, finding therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's, predicting kidney disease, preventing complications during surgery, enabling pre-hospital predictions for trauma patients, analyzing medical images, and improving our understanding of pan-cancer biology and genome biology.
