He received his B.S. (1996) and Ph.D (2003) in physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and Rice University, Houston, TX respectively. From 2003 to 2005, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 2005 and is currently a Professor and Director of the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility . He is an IEEE Fellow, Associate Editor for Nanoscale , a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award in 2009, EECS Outstanding Achievement Award in 2012, 2014-15 Rexford E. Hall Innovation Excellence Award, and the 2016-2017 David E. Liddle Research Excellent Award. To date he has published over 100 journal papers that have received over 20,000 citations with an h-factor of 61 ( Google Scholar ). Prof. Lu is currently advising 11 Ph.D. students and 3 Postdocs. He is also co-founder and Chief Scientist of Crossbar Inc , a Silicon Valley semiconductor company with over $100M VC funding to date to develop next generation non-volatile memories.
