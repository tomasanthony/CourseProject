 Subramanian Ramamoorthy Home research publications teaching links blog contact I am a Reader in the School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh , where I am affiliated with the Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour . I am an Executive Committee Member of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics . I lead the Robust Autonomy and Decisions research group, whose focus is on building robustly autonomous robotic systems and other decision making agents, capable of intelligently working with humans and other robots. This involves the development of new models and algorithmic techniques for (interactive) machine learning, planning and decision making, as well as practical work involving robots, wearable and networked sensors and human behavioural experiments. This is motivated by applications involving autonomous robotics, capable of actively learning and reasoning about models, and the uses of such interactively intelligent robots in homes, factories and field environments such as energy and environmental systems. Previously, I was at the Artificial Intelligence Lab in The University of Texas at Austin . Also, I spent several years working with National Instruments Corp. in the control design, dynamic simulation and computer vision groups.
