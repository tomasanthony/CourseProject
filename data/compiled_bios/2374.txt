Alireza joined the Department of Computer Science in 2017 as Lecturer in Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence. Prior to this appointment, he was a Research Fellow at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. He completed his PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at Imperial College where he also worked as a Research Associate on several research projects applying Machine Learning to real-world problems from Biology, Medicine and Ecology. His principal research interests are in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, in particular the theory, implementations and real-world applications of Relational and Logic-based Machine Learning (also known as Inductive Logic Programming). His current research interests also include: Data Science, Automated Scientific Discovery, Human-Like Computing (e.g. Human-Machine Learning), Explainable AI (e.g. Comprehensible Machine Learning),Computational Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Machine Learning of Biological Networks, and Genetic and Evolutionary Computation.Alireza has been collaborating with researchers within academia and industry and played a central role in developing several Machine Learning approaches for a range of applications in Data Science and Systems Biology (from genetic & metabolic networks to ecosystems). For example, his machine learning and text-mining approach for automated discovery & validation of probabilistic interaction networks from ecological data is regarded as the first successful application of machine learning from large-scale agricultural data. The results include novel food-web hypotheses, some confirmed by subsequent experimental studies (e.g. DNA analysis). Similarly, his work on machine learning of metabolic networks was regarded as the first successful application of machine learning for modeling inhibition in metabolic networks and the method developed in this project was used in studies by other researchers. The results of his research and the above mentioned collaborations have been published in Computer Science journals and proceedings (e.g. Machine Learning Journal) as well as high impact Biological and Ecological Journals (e.g. Advances in Ecological Research, IF=6.3; Trends in Ecology and Evolution, IF=16.7).[1] D.
