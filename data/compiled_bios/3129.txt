Active Research (more-) NEEDLE Vendors have closely integrated reconfigurable logic (e.g., FPGAs) into multicores that enable the software community to realize accelerators for specific program regions. We propose a methodical LLVM-based compiler approach to answer the question, what is acceleratable? and help software developers with early stage exploration of acceleration targets. Our hypothesis is that an entirely new program execution-based abstraction is needed to extract acceleratable regions from programs to help hardware synthesis tools. [IISWC'16,HPCA'16] FUSION Chip designers have shown increasing interest in integrating specialized fixed-function coprocessors. With increasing energy cost of wires and caches relative to compute operations, it is imperative to optimize data movement to retain the energy benefits of accelerators. We have developed a lightweight coherent cache hierarchy for accelerators to optimize the data movement. We are studying coherence based memory models for both GPUs [HPCA'13] and fixed-function coprocessors [ISCA'15].
