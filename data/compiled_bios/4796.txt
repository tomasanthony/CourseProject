JOSEPH Y. HALPERN Professor Cornell University Computer Science Department 414 Gates Hall Ithaca, NY 14853 Tel: (607) 255-9562; Fax: (607) 255-4428 halpern at cs dot cornell dot edu My research focuses on the interface between game and decision theory and computer science, on reasoning about knowledge and uncertainty, and on causality. I've also done work and continue to think actively about security, (fault tolerant) distriuted computing, and modal logic. My work lies at the boundary of a number of fields. I once gave a talk in the economics department at Princeton where I described myself as someone with a Ph.D. in mathematics, who calls himself a computer scientist, and is giving a talk to economists about a subject mainly studied by philosophers. That's probably the best one-sentence description I can give. If you'd like more details, check my list of publications . It has pointers to abstracts of all my papers; in many cases, the paper itself is also available. Other details of my activities are in my resume . My work is supported by NSF, ARO, and the Open Philanthropy Foundation. I typically teach one undergraduate course a year (often CS 2800) and a graduate course, typically one of Reasoning About Knowledge (COM S 6764) Reasoning About Uncertainty (COM S 6766) Decision-Making in Complex Environments (CS 5846, crosslisted as ECON3810 and ECON 6760), with some subset of Professors David Easley and Larry Blume in Economics.
