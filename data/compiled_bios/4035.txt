 News December 2018: I was elected AAAS Fellow . July 2018: Shih-Yun Lo, Shiqi Zhang, and I won the Best Robotics Track Paper award at AAMAS 2018. June 2018: We won first place at the the international RoboCup 2018 competition in the 3D simulation league UT Austin Villa for the 7th time in 8 years. September 2016: I published " Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 ", the first Study Panel Report of the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence . In February 2017 I delivered a lecture about it at an event hosted by the Prime Minister of Finland. March 2013: I spoke at TEDxYouth Austin on " Robot Soccer " (14 minute video). [ more ] I am the founder and director of the Learning Agents Research Group (LARG) within the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin , as well as associate department chair and chair of the University's Robotics Portfolio Program I am also the President, COO, and co-founder of Cogitai, Inc. My main research interest in AI is understanding how we can best create complete intelligent agents. I consider adaptation, interaction, and embodiment to be essential capabilities of such agents. Thus, my research focuses mainly on machine learning, multiagent systems, and robotics . To me, the most exciting research topics are those inspired by challenging real-world problems. I believe that complete successful research includes both precise, novel algorithms and fully implemented and rigorously evaluated applications. My application domains have included robot soccer, autonomous bidding agents, autonomous vehicles, autonomic computing, and social agents. See Short , Medium , or Long Professional Bio.
