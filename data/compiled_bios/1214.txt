Real-world security breaches rarely result from direct attacks on security mechanisms. Instead, attackers take advantage of applications that use these mechanisms incorrectly or violate their assumptions. Application developers should be domain experts, not security experts. I study language-based approaches to building decentralized and distributed applications that are secure by construction. Using high-level abstractions to synthesize low-level security protocols, programmers can build secure applications without being security experts. Building safe computers is hard. Real-world problems don't come from focused attacks on computer guards. Instead, attacks focus on computers that use guards wrong or break their guesses about the world. People that build computers should only have to be brains in their area, not safe computer brains. I study ways to tell computers what to do that are safe from the start. Using clear and simple ideas that tell computers how to make perfect guard controls, people can build safe computers without being safe computer brains.
