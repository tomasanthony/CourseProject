WM student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) : highly recommended for students interested in CS Charles Center at WM : check for scholarships in general and research experiences for undergrads (REUs) at WM in the summer in particular. The application deadline is always early in spring, e.g. March 2, 2016! Grace Hopper Conference : great opportunity for female CS students. GHC is the world's largest gathering of women technologists (about 15000 participants, October 2016, Houston, TX). The CS departments sends a team of students each year! Send an email to kemper at cs.wm.edu if you are interested. GHC applications for scholarships are due early in spring, e.g. March 30, 2016!
