I've also taught classes as an Adjunct Professor at Westminster College . I earned a PhD from the University of Utah in 2010 (advised by Jay Lepreau and Sneha Kasera ), and an Honors BS from the same institution in 2001. I'm a long-time Utahn, having lived here since 1987, and I've been at the University of Utah in various capacities since 1997. You can find a lot more in my CV . Research Interests I work in infrastructure : the systems underneath the software and services that we use everyday. I've published in operating systems, networking, distributed systems, cloud computing , and more . I'm also interested in the security of those systems, because concerns of security and privacy need to be built into infrastructure from the ground up. Infrastructure is a very emprical field, requiring lots of implementation and experimentation, so I'm also interested in experiment design and analysis , and in building testbeds for research; I have worked on Emulab and its sucessors, including CloudLab , parts of GENI , and PhantomNet , since 2000. One of the fundamental parts of the research process is building on and comparing to existing systems, so I also work in research reproducibility .
