I am the ~40 trillion gut bacteria, plus some smaller number of human cells, collectively known as Mike Gelbart. I was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As an undergraduate student at Princeton University, I studied physics and worked on research projects in biophysics. In graduate school I switched fields to computer science and received my PhD from the machine learning group at Harvard University. At UBC, I teach computer science and data science. My official job titles are Instructor in the Department of Computer Science and Option Co-Director of the Master of Data Science Program (Vancouver). For a non-exhaustive list of things that didnt work out along the way, see my CV of Failures . Projects Professional Projects I oversee and contribute to the UBC MDS blog . I recorded my lectures from CPSC 340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining), taught at UBC in the January 2018 session. I created a course on linear classifiers for DataCamp . I wrote Rhomboid , a set of Python scripts used to deliver courses via GitHub. There is also a demo video . I was one of the developers of Spearmint , a package for optimizing expensive functions using Bayesian optimization. I wrote some blog posts for the (now disbanded) Harvard Intelligent Probabilistic Systems groups blog. I wrote Embryo Development Geometry Explorer (EDGE), an image processing software package for developmental biology. Personal Projects I wrote The Magnum Opiate: a story of mystery, and intriguing . This time lapse video from 2011 demonstrates a new shaving technique that I developed. Photography and editing by Oren Rippel.
