We work at the boundary between architecture and systems software to build computer systems from the classical, like data centers , to the forward-looking, like brain interfaces . Some of our research has been integrated in commercial chips and operating systems. Specific contributions include coalesced TLBs , which are now implemented in AMD's chips ; hugepage optimizations that we have integrated into the Linux kernel ; and the compilation stack in the PsyNeuLink simulator for cognitive neuroscience . selected teaching and research more...
