GPUs, Deep learning and Embedded Systems are a rapidly growing segment of artificial intelligence. They are increasingly used to deliver near-human level accuracy for image classification, voice recognition, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, recommendation engines, and more. Applications areas include facial recognition, scene detection, advanced medical and pharmaceutical research, and autonomous, self-driving vehicles.  Our workshop will introduce students into Deep Learning on GPUs, more details here: http://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/nvidia-asu/            Lab News      Interaction Primitives library released   Nov 14, 2017   View  We released our interaction primitives library that was presented at CoRL2017 .
