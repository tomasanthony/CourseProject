 Home Publications Research Students Teaching Resources Bio Internal Associate Professor Vision, Learning and Graphics group, Dept. of Computer Science, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University I am also a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research . Address: Room 1226, 715 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA. Directions to lab Research Overview My research is in the areas of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am particularly interested in applying Deep Learning methods to object recognition. I also work on low-level vision problems, with applications to computational photography and astronomy. Deep Learning for Computer Vision NIPS 2013 Tutorial [Slides ] Online Recognition Demo See our deep convolutional network demo here . This network achieves 16.5% top-5 error on the Imagenet 2012 classification challenge, around 2% better than the network of Krizhevsky et al. (NIPS 2012).
