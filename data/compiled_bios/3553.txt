Michel Maharbiz: Contact Information 567 Cory Hall tel: 510-227-0196 maharbiz@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Biosystems & Computational Biology (BIO) Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) . Research Centers Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC) SWARM Lab Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses (CNEP) . . Biography Michel M. Maharbiz is a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on the extreme miniaturization of technology focused on building synthetic interfaces to cells and organisms. He is one of the inventors of "neural dust", an ultrasonic interface for vanishingly small implants in the body. His group is also known for developing the worlds first remotely radio-controlled cyborg beetles. This was named one of the top ten emerging technologies of 2009 by MITs Technology Review (TR10) and was in Time Magazines Top 50 Inventions of 2009. Prof. Maharbiz received his B.S. from Cornell University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley under nanotechnologist Professor Roger T. Howe (EECS) and synthetic biologist Professor Jay D. Keasling (ChemE); his thesis work led to the foundation of Microreactor Technologies, Inc. which was acquired in 2009 by Pall Corporation. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE (Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society) and a member of the Society for Neuroscience. Prof. Maharbiz is a Chan-Zuckerberg (CZ) Biohub Investigator (2017), a Bakar Fellow (2014), recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award (2009), a GE Scholar and an Intel IMAP Fellow. Michels long term goal is understanding developmental mechanisms as a way to engineer and fabricate machines. .
