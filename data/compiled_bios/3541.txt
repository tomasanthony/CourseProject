Edward L. Keller: Contact Information 278 Cory Hall tel: 510-642-3214 elk@ski.org : Research Areas Computational neuroscience; bioengineering; neurophysiology of the oculomotor system . . . Biography Prof. Edward L. Keller received the BS degree in Engineering Science from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1961 and served as a U.S. naval officer from 1961-1965; subsequently, he received the Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1971. He joined the EECS Department faculty in 1971. In 1977-78, he was a Visiting Professor at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Germany; chaired the campus Engineering Science Program from 1988-1994; served as Chair of the Joint UC Berkeley/UC San Francisco Graduate Group in Bioengineering for one year in 1989; and in 1989-1990, was a Visiting Scientist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. After retiring from the University as an Emeritus Professor in 1994, he became Associate Director of the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco where his laboratory conducts research on how the brain converts sensory inputs into appropriate signals to generate motor behavior. Specifically, most of his research is involved in uncovering the structural and functional organizations in the nervous system that carry out spatiotemporal transformations, using the saccadic system as a model. Prof. Keller is a Fellow of the IEEE. . . Selected Publications P. D. Thiem, E. L. Keller, and K.
