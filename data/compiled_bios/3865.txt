 Adriana Schulz Adriana Schulz Assistant Professor University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering Office: CSE 468 adriana [at] cs.washington.edu I am an assistant professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington , where I am a member of the Computer Graphics Group ( GRAIL ). My research focuses on computational design for manufacturing. As 3D printers and industrial robots begin to reshape manufacturing, my goal is to define design tools that will drive and democratize this new industrial revolution. I use data-driven methods to create intelligent tools that make design more efficient and accessible, and real-time performance-driven methods for design based on functionality. I incorporate these ideas into interactive tools that allow design of complex functional mechanisms that require design and optimization of not only geometry, but also motion and control.

During my PhD, I spent time at Columbia University working with Professor Eitan Grinspun , and, at MIT, I also worked closely with Daniela Rus , developing computational tools for robot design. Before starting my PhD, I obtained a Master's in Mathematics from IMPA , where I worked with Professor Luiz Velho and a Bachelor in Electronics Engineering from UFRJ , where I worked with Professor Eduardo da Silva .
