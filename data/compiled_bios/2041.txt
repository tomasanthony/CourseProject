Bucknell University Background I joined the Mathematics and Computer Science department in 2014 after teaching at Duke University as visiting faculty. I completed my Ph.D. (2010) in computer science from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, followed by a two-year postdoc at the University of Barcelona. As an undergraduate, I attended Bucknell University and graduated with a degree in computer science. My research is interdisciplinary and, at Davidson, I look forward to focusing on computer science as part of the liberal arts curriculum. I teach a wide variety of computer science courses, and fondly anticipate the expansion of course offerings. My research interests include computer graphics, virtual reality, human-computer interaction, 3D user interfaces, system design and evaluation, and human perception. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and have visited 18 different countries on four different continents. I indulge in the local cuisine, and relish trying new food.
