Samira Khan Assistant Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)Ph.D. University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), 2012Post-Doc Carnegie Mellon University, 2015 "We live in a society where data-centric computation is disrupting all aspects of our lives. With the rising volumes of data, our systems must be able to store, analyze, and transform massive amount of data for useful computation." Samira Khan, Assistant Professor I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Virginia (UVA), where I lead the research group ShiftLab . Before joining UVA, I was a post doctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, funded by Intel Labs and NSF GOALI award. I have received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at San Antonio.
