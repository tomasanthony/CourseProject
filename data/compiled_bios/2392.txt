 Wei Le Assistant Professor Computer Science , Iowa State University CV , Papers , Code and Data I am always looking forward to working with ambitious, highly motivated and talented students. Please contact me (weile@iastate.edu) if you are interested in research and software development opportunities in our lab. Recent Work and News [TSE19] Specifying Callback Control Flow of Mobile Apps Using Finite Automata, by Danilo Dominguez Perez and Wei Le Research Interests I work with Program Analysis Group at Iowa State University to design new program analysis algorithms as well as the applications of program analysis for software reliability, security and performance. We build software analysis systems and tools and enjoy both theoretical and practical aspects of program analysis.
