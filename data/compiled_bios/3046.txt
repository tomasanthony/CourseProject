 Fengwei Zhang Assistant Professor Director, COMPASS Lab Department of Computer Science Wayne State University Contact: Maccabees Building, Room 14109.3 5057 Woodward Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48202 Phone: (313) 577-1648 Email: fengwei at wayne dot edu Lab: Maccabees Building, Suite 2210 [ Curriculum Vitae ] I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Angelos Stavrou 's group at George Mason University in April 2015. My primary research interests are in the areas of systems security, with a focus on trustworthy execution, mobile malware analysis, debugging transparency, transportation security, and plausible deniability encryption. I am looking for graduate students, postdocs, undergraduate students to work with me on exciting projects in systems security. If you are interested, please send me your CV. RA positions are available. Nailgun project is online!
