My research builds the foundation of this paradigm and I am currently exploring this paradigm for problems in diverse disciplines such as hydrology, climate science, and computational chemistry. TKDE 2017 ArXiv 2017 Introduction to Data Mining (Second Edition) The second edition of this textbook presents new and improved content on several essential topics in data mining such as model overfitting, model evaluation, deep learning, class imbalance, and anomaly detection. Additionally, it introduces an entirely new chapter on avoiding false discoveries for data mining problemsa contribution missing in alternate resources at the required depth and breadth despite its importance. Book2017 Spatio-temporal Data Mining Space and time introduce several challenges and opportunities for classical data mining algorithms given the variety of data types, representations, problems, and methods in spatio-temporal settings. My recent survey provides an over-arching structure to the vast and diverse field of spatio-temporal data mining. A recurring theme of my research is to equip data mining methods with a better ability to deal with spatio-temporal data from Earth and environmental sciences. CSUR2017 KDD2017 BigData2017 BigData2016 GRSM2016 CISE2015 ArXiv 2017 Predictive Learning with Heterogeneity in Populations A central challenge in applying standard predictive learning methods for real-world problems is the heterogeneity in data populations, i.e., different groups of instances show different nature of predictive relationships. My dissertation research introduced several novel ways for addressing this challenge, building on ideas from multi-task learning and group-specific local learning .
