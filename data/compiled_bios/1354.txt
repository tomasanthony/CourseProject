Walter Gautschi Professor Emeritus of Computer ScienceProfessor Emeritus of MathematicsJoined department: 1963 EducationPhD, University of Basel, Mathematics (1953) Before coming to Purdue, Professor Gautschi did postdoctoral work as a Janggen-Phn Research Fellow at the National Institute of Applied Mathematics in Rome and at the Harvard Computation Laboratory. He also held positions at the National Bureau of Standards, the American University, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Tennessee. Since coming to Purdue, he has been a Fulbright Scholar at the Technical University of Munich and has held visiting appointments at the University of Wisconsin, Argonne National Laboratory, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, ETH Zurich, the University of Padova, and the University of Basel. He has been a Fulbright Lecturer, an ACM National Lecturer, and a SIAM Visiting Lecturer. He is, or has been, on the editorial boards of SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis, Numerische Mathematik, Calcolo, and Mathematics of Computation, and has served as a special editor for Linear Algebra and Its Applications. From 1984 to 1995, he was the managing editor of Mathematics of Computation and, since 1991, an honorary editor of Numerische Mathematik. In 2001, Professor Gautschi was elected a Corresponding Member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and, in the same year, a Foreign Member of the Academy of Sciences of Turin.
