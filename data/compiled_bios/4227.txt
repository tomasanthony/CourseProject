Joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of Kansas , 2017. Received Best Paper Award ofthe IEEE Transactions on Communicatioans (2016 Stephen O. Rice Prize in the Field of Communications Theory) along with co-authors, Sooyoung Hur, David J. Love, Jim V. Krogmier, Tim A. Thomas, and Amitava Ghosh. Check our recent work on "Outdoor Urban Millimeter Wave 3D Beam Alignment Using 3D Ray Tracing" 2016: (a) Video A (Setting) : Showing the UE's movement and rotation, antenna arrays at both UE and BS, six-sector BS configuration, and the street geometry. (b) Video B (Multicell & Single-UE) : Showing the beam-alignment and UE re-attaches to another BS when the original link is blocked. The frame duration is 10ms. The red line is the desired channel path. (c) Video C (Multicell & MultiUE) : Showing the intra-cell interference management. The green line is the downlink interference channel path. (d) Video D (Holistic View) : Showing more UEs runing in the simulator.
