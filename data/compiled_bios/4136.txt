Gabriel Robins Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 1983M.S. Princeton University, 1985Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 1992 "I design more efficient and effective algorithms to address practical real-world problems, which in turn helps many other fields." Gabriel Robins, Professor Professor Gabriel Robins earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA in 1992, where he received an IBM Fellowship and a Distinguished Teaching Award. He then joined the University of Virginia as Assistant Professor of Computer Science, where he received a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Lilly Foundation University Teaching Fellowship, the SIAM Outstanding Paper Prize, an All-University Outstanding Teacher Award, a Faculty Mentor Award, a Virginia Engineering Foundation Faculty Appreciation Award, a two-year early promotion to Associate Professor, and the Walter N. Munster Endowed Chair. He served on the U.S. Army Science Board, and is an alumnus of the Defense Science Study Group, an advisory panel to the U.S. Department of Defense. He has created the CS Web Team, the UVa Computer Museum, the CS Department Lounge, and the CS Poster Drive. He served on the program committees of several leading conferences, and served as Associate Editor of multiple journals, including the flagship journal IEEE Transaction on VLSI. He has directed over thirty students, and authored or co-authored a book, several book chapters, and over 110 refereed papers.
