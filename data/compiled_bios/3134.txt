If you are interested in building scalable software solutions for challenging problems in large-scale and high-performance computing, please email me a brief description about your work interests along with a copy of your CV. I am interested in the broad area of Parallel & Distributed Computing including their Programmability, Performance, Scalability & Fault Tolerance . My current work lies at an intersection of large scale graph processing and relaxed consistency semantics. [ Read More... ] I received my PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside , where my PhD advisor was Rajiv Gupta . I also worked as a visitng student researcher at University of California, Irvine where I worked with Harry Xu . SELECTED PUBLICATIONS (Click here for complete list of publications.)
