My research interests include solving practical networking and systems problems, with a focus on Software Defined Networking, data centers, clouds, and configuration management. In the past, I've conducted large scale measurement studies of data centers and enterprise networks; and I've developed several networked and distributed systems -- one of which was purchased in 2012.
