 Shusen Wang Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Stevens Institute of Technology EMAIL Shusen DOT Wang AT stevens DOT edu OFFICE North Building 205 Home CV Publications Teaching Miscellaneous About Me I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, Stevens Institute of Technology. From 2016 to 2018, I was postdoc scholar at Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley. I worked with Michael Mahoney . In 2011 and 2016, I got both of my doctoral and bachelor's degrees from Zhejiang University, China. My advisor was Zhihua Zhang . During my doctoral study, I have been supported by " the Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship " and " Baidu Scholarship ", which were the highest fellowships/scholarships in China. To prospective students: - I will take one or two PhD students and offer full financial support. Drop me a line if you would like to apply. - I will NOT offer RA position to master student. - I may take Stevens undergraduates who have high GPA and want to start research training early. But I am unable to provide financial support. Research Interest Machine learning Computational methods such as numerical optimization, matrix computation, bootstrap, etc. Statistical machine learning, ensemble methods, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods, Bayesian methods. Randomized numerical linear algebra Matrix sketching, randomized matrix computation, kernel approximation, etc. Distributed computing The design, analysis, and implementation of distributed algorithms (for machine learning and optimization).
