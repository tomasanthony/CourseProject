Theodore Van Duzer: Contact Information vanduzer@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Superconductor Electronics . . . Biography He obtained a B.S. from Rutgers University, an M.S. from UCLA and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He is currently a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at Berkeley. He is co-author of two texts: Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics (with S. Ramo and J. R. Whinnery) and Principles of Superconductive Devices and Circuits (with C. W. Turner). He is a Life Fellow of the IEEE, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a recipient of the Berkeley Citation and the IEEE/CSC Award for significant and Continuing Contributions to Applied Superconductivity. He has led a research group in superconductive electronics since 1968, including both devices and circuits. . Education 1960, PhD, EE, UC Berkeley 1957, MS, EE, UCLA 1954, BS, EE, Rutgers .
