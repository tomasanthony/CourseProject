 Home Research Chip Gallery Members Publications News Contact The group currently has multiple post-doc positions available Position Details Here Mission My group's research focus will cover a broad range of topics related to analog, mixed-signal, RF and mm-wave circuits. The emphasis of our work will focus on novel architectures and circuits which overcome the challenges presented by future low-cost, silicon technologies, such as ultra-low voltage, low-intrinsic device gain, and poor matching characteristic, to name a few. Some of my past work has been on integrated circuits for wireless communication systems requiring aggressive performance. A major emphasis of our future research will explore architectures and circuits for highly integrated, concurrently operating, heterogeneous-wireless systems which overcome the evolving challenges associated with co-existence. Other areas of research which I have an interest are mm-wave circuits for 60GHz and imaging applications, low-voltage highly-efficient transmitter systems, ultra-low power RF for cellular based sensor networks, high-speed I/O for chip-to-chip and core-to-memory applications and finally, integrated circuits for bio-medical applications.
