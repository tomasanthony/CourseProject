CHNG Eng Siong I am currently an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering SC SE , Nanyang T echnological University (NTU), Singapore. Concurrently , I am Asst Chair of Graduate Students for SCSE since Jan 2019. Prior to joining NTU in 2003, I worked in: Knowles Electronics (2001-2002), Lernout and Hauspie (1999-2000,Belgium), Institute of Infocomm Research (1996-1999,I2R, Singapore), and RIKEN (1996,Japan). I received both BEng (Hons) and PhD from Edinburgh University , U.K. in 1991 and 1996 respectively . My PhD was supervised by Bernard Mulgrew , P eter Grant and Chen Sheng . My area of focus is in speech research and signal processing. T o date, I have been Principal Investigator of several research grants awarded by NTU-R olls R oyce, Mindef , MOE and AStar with a total funding amount of over S $9 million under the Speech and Language R esearch Group at SCSE. I have supervised 11 PhD students and 6 Masters Engineering students. My publications include 2 edited books and over 100 journal/conference papers. What Google and Microsoft say about me. I have served as the publication chair for 5 international conferences (Human Agent Interac- tion 2016, INTERSPEECH 2014, APSIP A-2010, APSIP A-2011, ISC SLP -2006), and have been an associate editor for IEICE (special issue 2012), a reviewer for Speech Communications, Eupsico, IEEE T rans Man,System and Cybernectics P art B, Journal of Signal Processing System, ACM Multimedia Systems, IEEE T rans Neural Network, IEEE T rans CAS-II, and Signal Processing. I was the recipient of the T an Chin T uan fellowship (2007) to visit T singhua University , the JSPS travel grant award (2008) to visit T okyo Institute of T echnology , and the Merlion Singapore-France research collaboration award in 2009.

Karpathys "Doing well in a course" - link Advice T o W riting This section describes my take in how you can organize your thesis, nal year report, etc. F or PhD Students, my suggestion is that the structure is the most important aspect, and you should aim to get that right rst. E.g, you can write a series of questions to drive the report, and with the questions, write a power point (which provide more contents) towards answering the questions, and then nally the report. Y ou can have a look at 1. Chongs question and power point slide as an example. 2. Khassans writing and his question . I have other tips about writing thesis: word document (last updated: March 2016) and the mindmap Undergraduate FYP W riting Advice/Example: An example here T ools for W riting Please use latex for your writing - it will help a lot! In windows you have miktex . Y ou can get a host of templates here. My editor of choice is T exStudio - but ask Quora for the latest answer . Please see what Jonh Dennis had used to write his thesis. tip on tools he used for writing thesis. Y ou can start with using Xiao Xiongs latex PhD thesis template. W riting Advice from Others 1.
