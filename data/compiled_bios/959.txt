My work is funded by Huawei , Xilinx , NVIDIA , IBM , and NSERC . From July 2016 I was a Researcher in Systems Research Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond. I got my PhD from Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University , working with Professor Todd Mowry and Professor Onur Mutlu . My work was funded by NVIDIA Graduate , Microsoft Research , Qualcomm Innovation , and NSERC CGS-D Fellowships. Research I am generally interested in the areas of computer architecture, systems, and applied machine learning. My major research focus is on efficient memory hierarchy designs, systems for machine learning, approximate computing, compilers, and hardware acceleration.
