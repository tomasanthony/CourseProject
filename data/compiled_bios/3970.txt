Luke Hunsbergers research focus is on collaborative multi-agent systems. In particular, he is interested in endowing computer agents with intentions, as well as an ability to reason about temporal constraints, especially in group situations. He is currently collaborating with researchers from the University of Verona, Italy on applications of temporal networks to the health-care domain. Luke regularly teaches CMPU-101 (Introduction to Computer Science), CMPU-145 (Foundations of Computer Science), CMPU-245 (Declarative Programming) and CMPU-365 (Artificial Intelligence). Lukes personal website contains more information about his research interests, publications and courses.
