 Carla Schlatter Ellis Professor Emeritus Department of Computer Science Box 90129 Duke University Durham NC 27708-0129 Biography I received the B.S. degree from the University of Toledo, Toledo OH, in 1972 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Washington , Seattle, in 1977 and 1979. Before coming to Duke as an Associate Professor in 1986, I was a member of the Computer Science faculties at the University of Oregon, Eugene, from 1978 to 1980, and at the University of Rochester, Rochester NY, from 1980 to 1986. During the 1997-98 academic year, I was on sabbatical at the University of Washington. In my retirement, I will be pursuing two passions: (1) advocating for green computing and the role of computing in creating a sustainable society and (2) encouraging the participation of women in computing. I was named a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2010. Research I am an Experimental Computer Scientist with broad interests in operating systems for mobile, parallel, and distributed systems. Some of my interests and projects include The Milly Watt Power Management Project Mobile computing Sensor networks I am author of Controlling Energy Demand in Mobile Computing Systems , Synthesis Lectures on Mobile and Pervasive Computing , Mahadev Satyanarayanan, editor. Morgan & Claypool Publishers, 2007. A list of my publications is available. Some of my recent talks can be found at the Milly Watt talks page. Professional Service ACM: Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) , 2003-2009. Co-Program Chair of the MobiSys conference in 2008. Past Chair of ACM SIGOPS , the Special Interest Group on Operating Systems, past Chair of the ACM SIG Governing Board, and former member of ACM Council.
