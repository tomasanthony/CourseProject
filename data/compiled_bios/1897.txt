Home Publications Talks & Tutorials Research group Network data Network software Teaching Bio Press Contact Our group has several open research positions. More info here. Follow @jure Jure Leskovec. I am Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. My research focuses on mining and modeling large social and information networks, their evolution, and diffusion of information and influence over them. Problems I investigate are motivated by large scale data, the web and on-line media. I am also Investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. What's new Tutorial on Deep Learning for Network Biology.
