Research Interests I am interested in mobile and embedded computing , particularly in making mobile solutions more energy efficient. My focus lies on finding software solutions to save energy consumption whilst keeping the quality of experience for end users high. In so doing I am looking into the areas of both embedded programming and human computer interaction. I like to think that machine learning approaches and heterogeneous processing have high potential of bringing the research forward in these areas. In my role as University Teacher I am also interested in exploring which teaching tools and methods can optimally help students understand the concepts of computer science.
