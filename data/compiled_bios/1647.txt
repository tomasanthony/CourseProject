 Richards, Dana Office: 425 ST II E-mail: richards@cs.gmu.edu Phone: x1545 Research Interests: Comparisons of protein sequences Steimer tree algorithms Information dissemination in networks Parallel heuristics and methodology for computationally intractable problems Parallel algorithms for median filters Biosketch: Dana Richards received the Certificate of Intermediate Honors and the M.S. from the University of Virginia in 1976 and the Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1984, all in computer science. He has been a programmer for Comress, Inc., and Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and most recently a Program Director of Theory of Computing at the National Science Foundation. He has written or edited three books and numerous journal articles. In addition, he is a reviewer for many journals, and he has received numerous research awards. His research interest include comparisons of protein sequences, steimer tree algorithms, information dissemination in networks, parallel heuristics and methodology for computationally intractable problems, and parallel algorithms for median filters . Dr. Richards joined the faculty of George Mason University in the Fall of 1994 as an Associate Professor of Computer Science.
