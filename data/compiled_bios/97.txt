My research is on understanding the physics of novel nanostructured materials to create sensors and actuators. My group works on light detection and absorption of nanomaterials, the Smith-Purcell effect as well as multispectral analysis. We study nanostructured semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium and indium antimony, and metallic nanowires, such as gold, silver and magnetic metals.From these materials we fabricate different photonic and electromechanical sensors for environmental studies, mining explorations, food analysis, and microfluidic/photonic sensors and actuators for precision medicine.
