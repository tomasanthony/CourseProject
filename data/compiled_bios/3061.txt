Professional Experience Assistant Professor, University of Wyoming, 2012-Present Postdoctoral Fellow, Cornell University, Departments of Computer Science and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, 2010-2012. Postdoctoral Scientist, BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, Michigan State University, Summer 2010. Research Interests I study evolutionary computation, a technology that harnesses natural selection to evolve, instead of engineer, artificial intelligence, robots, and physical designs. I am also interested in learning how evolution produced the complex, diverse life on this planet. Here are some keywords that describe fields I perform research in: evolutionary algorithms (also known as genetic algorithms or evolutionary computation), neural networks (including evolving neural networks, having them learn, deep learning, and computational neuroscience), robotics, artificial intelligence, and research into the evolution of intelligence, complexity, evolvability, and altruism.
