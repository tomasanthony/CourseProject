Jennifer A. Lewis is the Hansjrg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Jianming Yu Professor of Arts and Sciences. She is also a Core Faculty Member and co-Lead of the 3D Organs Initiative at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard.She earned a Sc.D. in Ceramic Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Inventors, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has received numerous distinctions, including the 2017 Lush Science Prize, the Materials Research Society Medal, the Friedburg, Sosman, and Brunauer Awards from the American Ceramic Society, and the Langmuir Lecture Award from the American Chemical Society.Jennifer has made pioneering contributions to the directed assembly of soft functional, structural and biological materials. Her work integrates materials science, additive manufacturing, bioengineering, and soft matter physics to design and assemble synthetic and living materials with controlled composition, architecture, and properties across multiple length scales (~100 nm - 1 mm). Specifically, her team and their collaborators have created new classes of printed electronics, soft robotics, shape-morphing matter, and vascularized organ-specific tissues.Additionally, she has been actively engaged in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and outreach for nearly three decades and has recently co-founded two companies that are commercialling advances from her lab.
