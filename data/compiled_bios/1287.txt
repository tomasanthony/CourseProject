Pedro Fonseca Assistant Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 2018 Pedro Fonseca's research focuses on building systems that are both reliable and secure. During the last years, he has developed techniques and methodologies that are particularly suited to address this problem in the context of core software systems - the building blocks in modern computing that other software layers critically rely upon, such as operating systems, hypervisors and distributed systems. He tackles this problem from three directions:Gathering insights about the impact of emerging trends on reliability and security, by conducting real-world, empirical studies Building systematic testing tools that scale to modern, complex systemsDesigning and redesigning systems for reliability and security Selected PublicationsMultiNyx: A Multi-level Abstraction Framework for Systematic Analysis of Hypervisors 		[pdf].
