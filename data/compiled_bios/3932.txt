 Satish Narayanasamy Satish Narayanasamy Contact CV I am an Associate Professor in the EECS department at the University of Michigan . For prospective students: If you are interested in my research, please send me an email with your CV. Teaching EECS 570 - Parallel Computer Architecture (Fall 2009, Winter 2014) EECS 370 - Introduction to Computer Organization (Winter 2008, Fall 2011, Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Winter 2015, Fall 2016) EECS 598 - Ubiquitous Parallelism (Fall 2010, Winter 2012) EECS 483- Compiler Construction (Winter 2013, Winter 2011, Winter 2010, Winter 2009) Software and Downloads Maple tool for testing concurrent programs. For details refer to our OOPSLA 2012 paper . The release also includes concurrency API for Intel's Pin dynamic instrumentation tool, a Pin based implementation of CHESS , and a happens-before data-race detector. A collection of concurrency bugs that we used in OOPSLA'12 paper . Click here to download SC-preserving version of the LLVM compiler. For details refer to our PLDI 2011 paper . PinSEL -- a record-and-replay tool. It implements the BugNet checkpointing/logging scheme using the Pin dynamic instrumentation framework. PinSEL can record and replay any multi-threaded program across different system environments. Currently, it is used as a front-end for application level architectural simulators to avoid emulating the system effects. For more details refer to our SIGMETRICS'06 paper. Research Interests : I work at the intersection of computer architecture, software systems and program analysis. My current interests include customized computing solutions for genomics, concurrency, security, machine learning assisted program analysis, and tools for teaching at scale.
