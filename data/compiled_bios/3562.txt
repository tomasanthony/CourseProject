Niknejad received the Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley 2000, where he is currently a professor and faculty director of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC). Prof. Niknejad is an IEEE Fellow, the recipient of the 2012 ASEE Frederick Emmons Terman Award for his textbook on electromagnetics and RF integrated circuits. He was the co-recipient of the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) 2013 and 2010 Jack Kilby Awards for OutstandingStudentPapers, and the co-recipient of the Outstanding Technology Directions Paper at ISSCC 2004 for co-developing a modeling approach for devices up to 65 GHz. He is a co-founder of HMicro and the inventor of the REACH() technology, which has the potential to deliver robust wireless solutions to the healthcare industry. His general research interests lie within the area of wireless communications and biomedical sensors and imaging. His focus areas of his research include analog, RF, mixed-signal, mm-wave circuits, device physics and compact modeling, and numerical techniques in electromagnetics. .
