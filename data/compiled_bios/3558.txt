Richard S. Muller: Contact Information 568 Cory Hall tel: 510-642-0614 fax: 643-6690 muller@berkeley.edu : Research Areas Integrated Circuits (INC) Solid-State Devices Optoelectronics; Microsystem technologies; Sensors and actuators; Microelectromechanical systems . . . Biography He received the degree of Mechanical Engineer (with highest honors) from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, 1955; and his M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Physics, in 1957 and 1962, respectively, at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. From 1955 to 1962 he was a member of the technical staff at the Hughes Aircraft Company, Culver City, California. In 1962, he joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at UC Berkeley. His initial research and teaching on the physics of integrated-circuit devices led to collaboration with Dr. Theodore I. Kamins of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in writing Device Electronics for Integrated Circuits , first published by John Wiley & Sons in 1977, with a 2nd edition in 1986, and a 3rd edition appearing in 2002. Dr. Muller changed his research focus in the late 1970s to the general area now known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and he joined in 1986 with colleague Professor Richard M. White to found the Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC), an NSF/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. He has been awarded: the NATO and Fulbright Research Fellowships; an Alexander von Humboldt Senior-Scientist Award; the UC Berkeley Citation (1994); the Stevens Institute of Technology Renaissance Award (1995); the Transducers Research Conference Career Achievement Award (1997), the IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award (with Roger T. Howe, 1998) and an IEEE Millennium Medal (2000). He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Life Fellow of the IEEE, and has served as an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer. In 1990, he proposed to IEEE and ASME the creation of a MEMS technical journal, which began publication in 1991 as the IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems (IEEE/ASME JMEMS). Professor Muller is the author or co-author of more than 300 research papers and technical presentations and of 19 issued patents. . . Selected Publications R. Kant, D. Garmire, H. Coo, and R. S.
