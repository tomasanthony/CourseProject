 Jim Clarke I am a Senior Lecturer Emeritus in the Dept. of Computer Science at the University of Toronto . "Emeritus" means I'm retired. "Senior Lecturer" means that before retirement I was a faculty member in the teaching stream (as opposed to the research stream). The departmental grading programs The DCS grading program documentation is now at http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~clarke/grade . I still look after those programs, so please do ask me if you wonder about how to use them. There's also a succession plan, so there'll be someone to ask when I'm gone but I'm not telling you who the "someones" are, because they're hoping it never happens. Me too, actually. How to contact me by e-mail: clarke at cs dot utoronto dot ca by paper mail: Dr. J.N. Clarke Department of Computer Science University of Toronto 10 King's College Road, Room 3302 Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3G4 in person: I currently have no office in the Department of Computer Science.
