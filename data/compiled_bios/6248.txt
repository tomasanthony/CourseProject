My current research projects are: Reach Control Problem Here is a seminar on the topic presented at University of Waterloo, March 2014. Here is another seminar presented at UC Berkeley, April 2016. Our main application of reach control is motion control of quadrocopters. Here is a video . Here is a second video featuring Akela the dog.
