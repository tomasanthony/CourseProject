 Kousha Etessami Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science School of Informatics University of Edinburgh email: kousha at inf.ed.ac.uk I am a Professor in, and the current Director of, the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science , within the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh . Publications: publications available online . Research interests: In general, theoretical computer science. More specifically: automated verification, logic, algorithms and computational complexity theory, algorithmic game theory, equilibrium computation, analysis of probabilistic systems, Markov decision processes, stochastic games, automata theory, model checking, analysis of infinite-state systems, finite model theory and descriptive complexity. Teaching: Algorithmic game theory course . Discrete Mathematics course . (Stochastic) Modelling and Simulation course (Fall '05-'10). Compiling techniques course (Spring '03-'05). Some invited talks/tutorial slides Postdoctoral research associate: Vclav Broek (Newton Fellow, now at Google-Munich) Ph.D. students: Emanuel Martinov. Alistair Stewart (completed Ph.D. in 2014, now a post-doc at U. of Southern California.) Dominik Wojtczak (completed Ph.D. in 2009, now Lecturer at U. of Liverpool) I'm looking for Ph.D. students with a strong mathematics/theory background. If you are interested in applying for Ph.D. study with me, please contact me by email, and please apply via the School of Informatics postgraduate application web page . You are encouraged to also consider applying for a Ph.D. studentship within the Doctoral Training programme in Data Science or the Doctoral Training Programme in Pervasive Parallelism , both of which I have an affiliation with as a possible PhD supervisor. Software: PReMo: an analyzer for probabilistic recursive models (developed by D. Wojtczak).
