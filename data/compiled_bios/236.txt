 Shi Li's Home Page Shi Li Chinese: Since August 2015, I am an assistant professor at the department of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo . Before joining the University at Buffalo, I was a research assistant professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago . I received my Ph.D. in 2013 from the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University , where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Moses Charikar . I received my Bachelor's degree in 2008 from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University , where I was also a student of Andrew Chih-Chi Yao's Special Pilot Class . Here is my CV (last update: 12/12/18 21:57). Email: shil[a]buffalo[o]edu Research Interests Broadly speaking, my research area is theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in designing and analyzing approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial problems. Main types of problems I worked on include facility location problems, network routing and design, scheduling, resource allocation problems, etc. Currently, I am especially interested in the use of LP/SDP hierarchies in tackling these problems. My research is supported by NSF grant CCF-1566356 (CRII), CCF-1717134 and CCF-1844890 (Career Award). Publications Here is the full list of my publications .
