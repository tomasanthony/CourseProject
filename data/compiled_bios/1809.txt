While some may view these perspectives as more different than similar, I argue that they are connected by the common approach that considers action as critical for the understanding of space and object perception. This view is what drives my research in our Visual Perception and Spatial Cognition laboratory. In graduate school, I became intrigued by the proposal that perception is more than just our awareness of the world, but just as importantly, that perception serves the function of action in the world. While behavioral and neuropsychological evidence was provided for separate systems underlying awareness versus action in the world, I became most interested in how perception and action systems interact. I have pursued the interaction between perception and action in several ways, addressing mechanisms underlying space perception, perception of tools, and imagined spatial transformations. My research serves two goals: to further develop theories of perceptionaction processing mechanisms and to apply these theories to relevant realworld problems in order to facilitate observers understanding of their spatial environments. Opportunities For Students The Visual Perception and Spatial Cognition (VPSC) laboratory has many opportunities for undergraduate research assistants to participate in all aspects of our research. Our research is fun and interactive, involving tasks measuring space perception and spatial cognition in real and virtual environments. It is a great experience to add to graduate school applications as well! If interested, please email Dr. Creem-Regehr and see our lab web page. Dr. Creem-Regehr will be considering graduate student applicants to start in Fall 2018. Please email her with your interests.
