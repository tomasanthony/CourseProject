Spaepen conducts research in the following areas:Colloidal systems as analog computers for the study of defects and deformation of crystals and glasses (with D. Weitz).Amorphous materials (metals, semiconductors, polymers): structure, formation, stability, mechanical properties, atomic transport (viscosity, diffusivity, structural relaxation, crystallization).Properties of interfaces: crystal/melt, amorphous/crystalline semiconductor, grain boundaries, grain growth, interface tension, interface stress, and interface stiffness.Thin films and multilayers: preparation, stability, mechanical properties.General effects of size scale on mechanical properties.
