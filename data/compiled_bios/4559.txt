Monroes doctoral work at the University of Maryland focused on the analysis of temporal, event-based records, such as electronic health records and transaction logs. The EventFlow visualization tool that she developed has been used by Washington D.C. Childrens Hospital, the U.S. Army Pharmacovigilance Center, University of Floridas College of Medicine, and many others. Her interests cover not only a wide range of computation, but also the application of computational thinking as a general problem-solving technique.
