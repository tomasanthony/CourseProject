Other Activities When I arrived at McGill, I started the School of Computer Science Colloquium lecture series. I have also been involved in the creation of the School of Computer Science Game Programming Guru summer camp for high school students. I am also regularly organizing one week modeling workshops at the Bellairs McGill Research Institute in Barbados ( April 2009 , April 2010 , April 2011 , April 2012 , February 2013 ). The 2014 edition of the Bellairs modelling workshop was themed Modelling outside the Box. In 2015 , the workshop theme was focussed on concern-driven software development, and in 2016 the theme is Modelling for Sustainability.
