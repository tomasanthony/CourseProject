 My research interests primarily lie in algorithm design and analysis, focusing on parallel algorithms, scheduling, and memory-efficient or large-data algorithms. I am also interested in classic (sequential) algorithms and data structures. For more details, please view my CV. I am currently on sabbatical at University of Sydney. I am thus not looking to take on any new students. Before starting at Georgetown in 2011, I was a Computing Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Guy Blelloch. I received my Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Charles Leiserson acted as my advisor. I received my A.B. from Dartmouth College.
