Please follow this link to book a meeting with me doodle.com/annacox . Research: My research explores the impacts of technology for making us healthy, happy and more productive with a particular focus on work-life balance and wellbeing. Digital health and wellbeing The impacts of being always-on (including dealing with interruptions, and digital work-life boundary management) Which strategies are effective for helping us to manage our digital technologies? Can these strategies improve our wellbeing? Digital activities for dealing with work-related stress and low mood (particularly playing videogames) Personal informatics and serious games to support self-management of mental health Digital interventions to improve physical activity and encourage movement Productivity How effective are the digital tools that promise to help us increase focus and get work done? How can tasks be designed to increase productivity and efficiency and reduce errors? Understanding interruptions at the micro (window switching), meso (task or work sphere switching) and macro (life sphere switching) levels Increasing productivity in volunteer and paid digital workplaces (citizen science and Mturk) I have the great fortune to work with some amazing people.
