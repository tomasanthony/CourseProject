David Forbes Delchamps Associate Professor Electrical and Computer Engineering Frank H T Rhodes Hall, Room 329 607/255-6447 dfd1@cornell.edu Back to Directory: Biography David F. Delchamps is originally from Mountain Lakes, NJ. He majored in electrical engineering as an undergraduate at Princeton and received his doctorate in applied mathematics from Harvard. Since 1982 he has been on the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a member of the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell, where he is currently an associate professor. He is the author of a number of technical articles along with the book State Space and Input-Output Linear Systems (Springer, 1988). He is a senior member of IEEE and a member of the American Mathematical Society. Hie does research in the broad area of control and systems theory. He has a special interest in applying ideas from dynamical systems theory and evolutionary game theory to the modeling and analysis of large complex systems.. Research Interests Applications of dynamical systems theory to control and signal processing; evolutionary game theory, with applications to large complex systems. Complex Systems, Network Science and Computation Signal and Image Processing Systems and Networking . Teaching Interests Recently I have taught three courses on a regular basis. One is ECE 3250, Mathematics of Signal and System Analysis, which is an important course for students intending to concentrate in the systems area of ECE. Another is ENGRI 1260, Introduction to Signals and Telecommunication, now retired. The third is a course related to my research, ECE 4271, Evolutionary Process, Evolutionary Algorithms, Evolutionary Games. I have also taught ECE 5210, Linear System Theory, many times; ECE 4670, Digital Communications, one time; and ECE 2200, Signals and Information, one time, with the expectation that I'll teach it again in the relatively near future.
