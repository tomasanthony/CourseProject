Looking forward to meeting you . Nadia Berthouze is Professor in Affective Computing and Interaction. Her main area of expertise is the study of body posture/movement as a modality for recognising, modulating and measuring human affective states in HCI. She has published more than 170 papers in affective computing, HCI, and pattern recognition. She was awarded the 2003 Technical Prize from the Japanese Society of Kansei Engineering and she has been invited to give a TEDxStMartin talk (2012). She is/was: PI on the EPSRC-funded Emo&Pain project to design affective technology to support rehabilitation in chronic pain; co-I on the EPSRC-funded Digital Sensoria project investigating the use of biosensors to measure subjective responses to tactile experiences; co-I on the ILHAIRE project investigating laughter in human-avatar interaction; EU-FP7 Marie Curie IRSES UBI-HEALTH: Exchange of Excellence in Ubiquitous Computing Technologies to Address Healthcare Challenges, H2020 HUMAN Manufacturing, and HOLD funded by the Wellcome Trust. The premise of her research is that affect, emotion, and subjective experience should be factored into the design of interactive technology. Indeed, for technology to be truly effective in our social network, it should be able to adapt to the affective needs of each user group or even each individual. The aim of her research is to create systems/software that can sense the affective state of their users and use that information to tailor the interaction process. Body movement and touch behaviour are major medium for this goal: they support cognitive processes, regulates emotions, and mediates affective and social communication. She is currently pursuing three lines of research looking at these modalities as channels to induce, recognize and measure the quality of experience of humans and in particularly of humans interacting and engaging through/with technology in various domains including physical rehabilitation. In the context of physical rehabilitation, she is investigates how multisensing and multimodal technology can help overcome the psychological barriers to remain physically active and re-engage with one's own body.
