Skip to content Sanjay Krishnan Database Research @ U Chicago       How much of data analytics can we automate? Data scientists spend many hours manipulating and cleaning data, writing careful/scalable data analysis programs, and debugging analyses. My group explores the intersection of AI and Data Sciencetowards a world where intelligent systems can automatically perform many of the data analytics tasks we currently expect humans to do. News/Updates 1/23/19 New paper on Band-limited Convolutions for adaptive resource control during model training. Stay tuned for a preprint! 1/13/19 Going to CIDR, will present a new paper on visual data management. https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07607 1/09/19 Blog post! https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/what-is-the-role-of-machine-learning-in-databases/?twitter=@bigdata 12/15/18 NeurIPS Invited Workshop Talk:  http://mlforsystems.org/ Current Projects We are always looking for exceptional undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs! Email me. skr @ cs . uchicago Deep Query Optimization. What is the role of machine learning in the design and implementation of a modern database system? This question has sparked considerable introspectionin the data management community, and the epicenter of this debate is the core database problem of query optimization, where the database system finds the best physical execution path for an SQL query. Read our recent research paper on this. A Formal Theory of Data Science: Datasets often undergo a sequence of rule-based transformations before they are used in any data analytics. Many data scientists craft these rules by hand after observing representative samples of data. However, as with any type of decision rules, the chosen transformations might be overly specific to those errors manifest in the sample, or conversely, may have unforeseen side-effects on unseen data.We seek to formalize this process and understand when data transformation scripts can be expected to generalize. DeepLens, A Visual Data Management System: New results in deep learning give us tools to add structure to natural data like images and video. We explore using these tools to answer semantic queries on image and video. Read our paper published at CIDR 19. Optimizing Machine Learning Programs.TrainingMachineLearningmodels at scale is a core application for many distributed systems. We explore adaptive optimization, auto-scaling, and model compression.L Publications How do we build systems that continuously learn from real-world interactions?
