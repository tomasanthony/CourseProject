Ellie {Pavlick, Tobochnik} I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown University , and an academic partner with Google AI . I am interested in building better computational models of natural language semantics and pragmatics: how does language work, and how can we get computers to understand it the way humans do? Several of my recent projects and interests are described below. If you are a Brown undergrad or Masters student and are interested in getting involved with the lab, please read this . Language Representation and Inference When humans reason about language, we can be incredibly flexible or we can be highly precise. How can we codify the full range of human inferences about language, in a way that is simple and concrete enough to be accessible to computers? More -> Stylistics, Framing, and Implicit Meaning Language is about more than "who did what to whom, when, where, why, and how". Can we teach computers to pay attention not just to what people say, but also to how they say it, and to the implications of speakers' wording? More -> Crowdsourcing for NLP and Data Science Data is everywhere. Labelled data, not so much. How can we design tasks and incetivize people to help us transform massive amounts of data into something useful, from which we can train models, conduct experiments, and build insights?
