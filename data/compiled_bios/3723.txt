 Hongyang SUN Skip to content About Publications Activities News I am a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of Vanderbilt University, USA. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Before moving to Vanderbilt, I have worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at ENS (Lyon), INRIA (Rhne-Alpes), and IRIT (Toulouse) in France. My research focuses on the broad area of improving performance , energy efficiency (green computing, thermal-aware computing), and reliability (resilience, fault tolerance) of High-Performance Computing (HPC), cloud computing, and distributed computing systems and applications. I am interested in design and analysis of algorithms , resourcescheduling , performance modeling and optimization . Recently, I have started working on data-intensive computing (e.g., memory-bound or I/O-bound computations, cache efficiency). I am also interested in data science in generaland the application of HPC in particular to solve big-data problems that arise in various fields (e.g., machine learning, neuroscience). If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please dont hesitate to drop me an email.
