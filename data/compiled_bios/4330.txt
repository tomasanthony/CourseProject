Jorge Sefair Jorge Sefair, an assistant professor, earned his Ph.D. from University of Florida in 2015. Sefair was awarded a University of Florida Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate student research award in 2015. In 2013 and 2015 he received National Science Foundation (NSF) Travel Grant Awards for IIE Annual Conference. His research interests include network optimization, robust optimization, integer programming, applications of optimization in environment, public policy, urban planning, and finance. His current research focuses on the use of optimization techniques for the design of resilient systems that maintain a critical level of operation even under adverse uncertain circumstances. In particular, he is motivated by applications of operations research in environment, public policy, and urban planning. His research has been interdisciplinary, having published academic works with colleagues from a variety of disciplines, including civil engineering, public health, ecology, biology, and economics. jsefair@asu.edu 480-965-3190 BYENG 330 Education Ph.D., Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, 2015 M.Sc., Industrial Engineering, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia), 2008 B.A., Economics, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia), 2006 B.Sc., Industrial Engineering, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia), 2005   Research interests Network optimization, robust optimization, integer programming, applications of optimization in environment, public policy, urban planning, and finance Awards  Univ. of Florida Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering 2015 graduate student research award 2013 and 2015 National Science Foundation (NSF) Travel Grant Awards (IIE Annual Conference) Runner-up for the 2015 INFORMS Computing Society Best Student Paper award   October 15, 2015 Erik Wirtanen                      Sign In / Sign Out    Sign In     Menu    ASU Home  My ASU   Colleges & Schools   Arts and Sciences  Business  Design and the Arts  Education  Engineering  Future of Innovation in Society  Graduate  Health Solutions  Honors  Journalism  Law  Nursing and Health  Public Service and Community Solutions  Sustainability  University College  Thunderbird School of Global Management     Map & Locations   Map  Tempe  West  Polytechnic  Downtown Phoenix  Online and Extended  Lake Havasu  Skysong  Research Park  Washington D.C.
