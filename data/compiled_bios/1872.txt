It is a common mistake to think of Genomics as a sub-field of Genetics. It is not. Genomics and Genetics are equals. The only reason Genetics has taken the lead is that we have had access to the phenotype forever. We have only had access to our full Genome for little over a decade. But boy, what a view. If Genetics is the Earth, Genomics is the Sun. We, humans, care most about the Earth, but we realize it revolves around the Sun.
