 Daniel Lokshtanov About Me Students Publications Teaching Funding Contact Photo: Eivind Senneset I am an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Barbara . I do resarch in Theoretical Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics, most of it in Algorithmic Graph Theory and Parameterized Complexity , which also was the topic of my Phd. thesis . Outside work, I enjoy hiking, skiing, fantasy, sci-fi, cognac, parmesan and football (the real kind). Many years ago I starred in Fana school theatre . I'm also involved with organizing the Norwegian Informatics Olympiad for high school students. Textbook from Springer: Parameterized Algorithms by Marek Cygan, Fedor V.
