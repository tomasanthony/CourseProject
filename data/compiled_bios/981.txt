 Hector Levesque My research is in the area of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence. On the representation side, I've worked on the formalization of a number of concepts pertaining to artificial and natural agents including belief, goals, intentions, ability, and the interaction between knowledge, perception and action. On the reasoning side, my research mainly concerns how automated reasoning can be kept computationally tractable, including the use of local search methods. More , you say? Less ?
