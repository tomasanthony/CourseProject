As director of the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation, Norm investigates computer graphics and artificial intelligence techniques and applications for embodied agents, virtual humans, and human-computer interaction. His major research directions include developing behavior-based animation of human movement for individuals and groups, constructing a parameterized action representation for real-time simulation and animation, and studying the relationship among human movement, natural language, and communication. Norm's crowd and populace simulation research incorporates environmental context and animates actors with roles and stochastic, scheduled, reactive, and opportunistic behaviors.
