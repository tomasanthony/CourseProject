Wenliang (Kevin) Du Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-285 CST 315.443.9180 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D. 2001, from Purdue University Research Interests: Computer and network security Smartphone and mobile system security Security education Current Research: Recent work has involved the studies of the Android operating systems with the following goals: (1) identify security problems in the design of the Android operating system, (2) identify security problems in mobile apps and develop tools to detect them, (3) develop improved access control for mobile systems. Other current work includes the development of effective hands-on lab exercises for security education. We started the work in 2002, and we have developed about 30 labs for both undergraduate and graduate students. As of September 2015, over 350 universities and colleges worldwide are using them.
