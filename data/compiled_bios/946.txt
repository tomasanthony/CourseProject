In the past I have also worked on database concurrency control. Here is a list of papers that I have (co-)authored, along with abstracts and, in some cases, postscript versions. I have been on the editorial board of Distributed Computing since 1997, and was the journal's editor-in-chief during 2000-2008. In the past, I also served on the editorial boards of the SIAM Journal on Computing (1998-2005) and the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (1996-1999).
