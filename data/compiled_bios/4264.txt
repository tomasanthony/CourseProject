Currently, we are extending our BondFlow system for biological workflows. Also, Currently I am collaborating with several other faculty members in this project.    Gene Family Member Identification :  Currently, I am involved in research activities at bioinformatics research group directed by Dr. Fikret Ercal in gene family member identification. Our goal is to find efficient and accurate algorithms and methodologies identify members of gene family.   BondFlow System: (http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~cscjlbx/bondflow/bondflow.html): Objective of the BondFlow system is to develop collaborative applications including workflows over distributed web services. This involves investigating a minimum set of coordination primitives and architectural styles for distributed web services coordination. The BondFlow project has been initiated based on my dissertation work. I have had significant success in this project including a working prototype. In this project I had the opportunity to steer the software design and implementation aspects of two Georgia State University M.S. thesis students under the direction of my advisor Prof. Sushil K. Prasad.      RESEARCH Collaborations     Dr. Sushil K.
