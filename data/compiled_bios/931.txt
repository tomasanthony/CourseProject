 Home Lab Background News Contact Jessica Burgner-Kahrs Associate Professor, Computer Science Director Continuum Robotics Laboratory , University of Toronto Continuum robots are our passion! Their mechanical structure is fundamentally different from conventional robots. They have a joint-less body which is continuous. This structure is inspired by biological trunks (e.g. elephant), tentacles, tongues, and worms. A continuous structure enables to traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and to conform to curvilinear paths in task space. Think about what continuum robots can do that is not possible with serial robot arms, mobile robots, or humoid robots! I will be joining the Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences at the University of Toronto Mississauga in March 2019 as Associate Professor. Currently, I am Associate Professor and Director of the Laboratory for Continuum Robotics at Leibniz Universitt Hannover in Germany. I am looking for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students to join my research group in Toronto! Apply through CS , ECE , or MIE . 2019 Jessica Burgner-Kahrs Contact: jbk at cs.toronto dot edu
