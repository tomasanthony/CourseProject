My research interests include probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian deep learning, spatial data modeling, text modeling. See my publication list . Ongoing research projects Amortized variational inference for Gaussian processes [ Liu & Liu, 2018 ] Embedding models: generalization of embedding models to items [ Liu & Blei, 2017 ] [ bird embedding ]. Spatial modeling: model spatial data with Gaussian processes Image Segmentation/Generation: segmenting images from probabilistic models Previous research projects Gaussian approximation of CGM , Superset (partial) label learning , Active learning for clustering , Labeling extremely imbalanced data Teaching Spring 2019: COMP 150 Deep Neural Networks Fall 2018: COMP 135 Introduction to Machine Learning Spring 2018: COMP 135 Introduction to Machine Learning Fall 2017: COMP 150-01 Machine Learning for Ecology and Sustainability Bio Sketch I received my B.S. in computer science from Hebei University of Technology in 2006. After three years study in LAMDA group , I received my M.S. degree from Nanjing Univeristy in 2009. My advisor was Prof. Yuan Jiang and Zhi-Hua Zhou . Then I worked in Alibaba for one year and a half. After that, I went to Oregon State University and completed my PhD degree in 2016. My PhD advisor was Prof. Thomas Dietterich . Prior to joining Tufts, I worked as a postdoc researcher at Columbia University working with Prof. David Blei . Designed with Jekyll and Markdown by Liping Liu. Last modified on 11/05/2018
