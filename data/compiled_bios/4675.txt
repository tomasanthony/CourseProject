In this role, Edmon is responsible for research and designof advanced, large-scale systems for computing on protecteddata. He also currently serves as the Principal Investigator (PI) for the joint DOE and VA precision medicine program (MVP CHAMPION). During his tenure at ORNL, Edmon also led several major national projects in healthcare and defense, and was a chief architect for Knowledge Discovery Initiative (KDI) for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) -- a large national program aimed at developing a platform for comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the large, structured healthcare datasets (CMS data). Prior to serving as the Chief Data Architect at ORNL, Edmon was a Chief Data Officer at the Joint Institute for Computational Sciences/National Institute for Computational Sciences (JICS/NICS), a NSF funded XSEDE national supercomputing facility and a joint institute between ORNL and University of Tennessee (UT). While at JICS, Edmon was one of the core members of the team that won and established the NSF-funded Southeast "Big Data" Hub, and was a principal investigator on a research project for the Intel Parallel Computing Center (PCC). Prior to working at the research institutes, Dr. Begoli held technology leadership positions at atechnology startup, and the large commercial organizations. Edmonis a member of the IEEE, ACM, and Apache Software Foundation (ASF) where he is a committer on the Apache Calcite project. He is also a principal member of the INCIT DM32.2 Task Group on Data Management and Databases . Edmon holds undergraduate, graduate (University of Colorado-Boulder), and doctoral degrees (University of Tennessee)in Computer Science.
