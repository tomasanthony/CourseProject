 Erik Brunvand Associate Professor, School of Computing , University of Utah Adjunct Assoc. Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University Professor, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 academic years 50 S. Central Campus Dr., Rm MEB 3190 Salt Lake City, Utah 84112 email: elb at cs dot utah dot edu For (somewhat) more information, see my plan file (mostly a historical holdover from when text-based plan files were all the rage in UNIX systems... We're talking '70s and '80s here...) Professor Brunvand joined the Department of Computer Science in 1990. He has interests in computer architecture and VLSI systems in general, and self-timed and asynchronous systems, and in graphics processing systems in particular. One aspect of his research involves compiling concurrent communicating programs into asynchronous VLSI circuits. The current system allows programs written in a subset of occam, a concurrent message-passing programming language based on CSP, to be automatically compiled into a set of self-timed circuit modules suitable for manufacture as an integrated circuit. He is also interested in investigating the effects of asynchrony on computer systems architecture at a higher level. Most recently he and his students have been exploring a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture that is targeted at Ray Tracing - a rendering technique that can generate highly realistic computer graphics images by simulating the transport of light in the virtual scene.

CS 5789: Embedded Systems and Kinetic Art .This is a cross-college collaborative class on embedded systems and kinetic art that I teach with Paul Stout - a colleague in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of Utah. (current class, Spring 2015) UGS 2050: Making Noise - Sound Art and Digital Media This is a brand new undergraduate general education course that I've developed as part of my University Professorship in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 academic years. (current class, Spring 2015) Kinetic Art and Embedded Systems I have been interested for some time in arts/technology collaborations. Here are some presentations and other materials that I've written recently.
