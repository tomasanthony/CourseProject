Google Scholar Courses Taught CS/ECE 4457 Computer Networks CS 4501 Internet of Things Featured Grants & Projects Energy-efficient Smart Buildings Buildings account for 40% of the total US energy budget, the largest energy consuming sector in the country, and many government and public organizations agree that a national grand challenge is to achieve a 70% reduction in building energy by 2030. However, energy retrofits are extremely costly. We are developing computational alternatives to conventional retrofits that use a combination of embedded sensing, intelligence, and control to save energy at 10x to 100x lower cost than conventional approaches. A cornerstone of this work is new technology to identify and track individual people, recognize common activity patterns, and detect object usage. These sensing technologies allow buildings to provide heating and cooling, lighting, and water heating services that respond to the dynamics of occupant presence, activities, and goals. Our current data predicts that, if they were deployed in every home, these techniques would reduce total US energy consumption by almost 3%, more than the energy used by the entire commercial airline industry. Network Tasking Many forecast that the Internet of Things will grow to over 1 trillion objects in the next two decades. However, people cannot practically coordinate the 1000s of connected objects they will encounter every day to help with their daily tasks. Networks of coordinating devices are too complex to operate with conventional human controls such as dials, switches and knobs. We are creating new tools and techniques to dynamically compose objects in a goal-driven fashion, adapting in real-time to changes in either network resources or high-level objectives. We have demonstrated these techniques in both static networks and networks that include aerial drones. In addition to goal-oriented tasking, we have shown that these tools enable system-level analysis, run-time visibility and debugging, and testing and verification, even in the face of severe limitations on energy, memory, and bandwidth.
