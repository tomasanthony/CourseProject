In particular, I am working on formal verification, enterprise modelling, workflow analysis, and social machines, and their applications in healthcare and manufacturing . I am interested in applied research on machines that can help people collaborate better , for example by digitizing processes, integrating the latest technologies, allowing better control over their data, and formally establishing trust. I am a member of the Centre of Intelligent Systems and their Applications (CISA) and the Mathematical Reasoning (DReaM) group. I am an entrepreneur at heart, passionate fortranslational research, commercialisation, and innovation. I advocate lean startup techniques and customer/user-centred development in applied research. My main industry-facingproject WorkflowFM provides consultancy and infrastructure for workflow management using formally verified models, in collaboration with the industry and the public sector. Application domains include healthcare (optimizing care pathways and everyday clinical practices in the NHS) and Industry 4.0 (digitizing manufacturing workflows in the ongoing Digiflow project).

In particular, I research formal workflows as collaboration contracts that specify the involved processes within or across networks and organisations, in a way that is unambiguous and understandable, yet amenable to rigorous analysis and deployment. Combining these with data sources , such as IoT sensors, and AI poses a fantastic opportunity towards a better understanding of every day collaboration and unique insights towards improving efficiency and alleviating administrative burdens. Process Modelling I provide consultation for systematic process modelling of collaborative tasks . I develop diagrammatic, process-based models in close collaboration with the involved stakeholders. I help them understand and formalise their everyday workflows. Formal Verification I use mathematical logic and mechanical theorem proving to formally specify requirements and verify system properties.In particular, I am interested in automated reasoning, theorem proving, embedded logics, and linear logic. Formal verification can be used to provide mathematical guarantees of correctness and enhance trust in modern systems. Workflow Analysis and Deployment A big part of my research is on AI-based methods and tools for analysis and deployment of coordination protocols as workflows, including verification , concurrent enactment , decentralised architectures, and self-evolving workflows . Such technology can helppeople collaborate efficiently, transparently, and with less administrative effort. Internet of Things I am interested in the coordination of IoT-enabled machines and the management and analysis of IoT sensor data . Integrating such data with workflow management systems allows for advanced, contextualized live monitoring with unique operational insights to improve decision support (scheduling, resource allocation, process management, etc). Technology Innovation I investigate cultural, ethical, and resource constraints in data-driven innovation and change management in large and public organisations, including issues of privacy and responsibility . Healthcare Informatics Applications of my research aim to improve everyday practices and the coordination of health and social care teams. I help NHS teams developand optimize models of care in order to deliver safer and more consistentcare across patients. Projects This list is not exhaustive.
