Premier's Catalyst Award for Best Young Innovator, Ontario, 2009.	Premier's Research Excellence Award, Ontario, 2003.	Selected Software	Novor.	Novor is the first and only de novo peptide sequencing software with a speed that exceeds the throughput of today's fastest mass spectrometer.	On a laptop computer, it can de novo sequence more than 300 spectra per second.	The accuracy is also significantly better than other available software packages.	It is free for academic usages.	PEAKS (versions 1.0 to 7.0): PEAKS is the most popularly used peptide de novo sequencing software from mass spectrometry data.	Software was initially written by me and then has been developed at Bioinformatics Solutions Inc. under my direction since 2002.	I have led the development of PEAKS from its version 1.0 to 7.0; but have moved on to the Novor project since Jan. 2015.	GlycoMaster DB:	GlycoMaster DB identifies glycopeptides with their mass spectral data. Software was written by my former Ph.D. student Lin He.	CHAMPS:	CHAMPS software sequences a protein's amino acid sequence from its tandem mass spectrometry data and a homologous protein. Software was written by my former postdoc Xiaowen Liu.
