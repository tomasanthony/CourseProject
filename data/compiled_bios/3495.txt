These are essentially sets of equations directed from left to right, indicating that instances of the left-hand side may be replaced by the corresponding instances of the right-hand side. Such systems may be used as programming languages, and are also useful for theorem-proving applications. We are investigating methods of combining term-rewriting systems with first-order theorem provers. We developed a way of handling AC symbols using permutations and implemented it. We also studied techniques for applying efficient permutation group algorithms to equational theorem proving. Mechanical theorem proving. We are investigating methods to automate the process of searching for and checking proofs. This has applications to program verification and to teaching logic and mathematics, since a proof checker can be helpful for instructional purposes. We have developed a sequence of theorem-proving methods, the most recent being clause linking with semantics and ordered semantic hyper-linking. At the same time, we have developed analytical methods for studying the search efficiencies of theorem-proving strategies. As a result, we have developed provers that are among the best in terms of being able to prove a wide variety of non-equality problems with a minimum of human guidance. We have applied these provers to problems involving concept description languages in AI and planning problems, with good results. We have also investigated rigid E-unification, which is a version of unification relevant for certain theorem proving methods (based on "matings"). Logic programming. We have developed some simple but effective tests that permit the occurrence check in Prolog to be eliminated in most cases, while guaranteeing the same semantics as true unification. Program verification. We have developed theoretical methods for automatically generating the inductive assertions in program verification. We would like to see to what extent this can be implemented and applied to program verification. Program generation. We are studying the proofs-as-programs paradigm, in which programs are expressed as proofs in a logical system. This system permits the generation of programs that are correct with respect to their specifications. Our approach combines constructive and classical logic, with classical logic being used for the parts of the proofs that have no computational content. Also, our approach can handle nondeterminism and nonterminating programs. Publications from DBLP as of 1999 Book Ad Selected Publications (For copies of my publications, send me email.
