Biography I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Stevens Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Rutgers University in 2018. Before that, I received the B.S. in Mathematics in 2011 and the M.S. in Computer Science in 2014, both from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During 2013 and 2014, I was a visiting scholar at the Learning and Vision Research Group, National University of Singapore. Research My research interests lie in both the theoretical aspects and applications of machine learning. I am particularly interested in high-dimensional statistics, large-scale optimization, and their interplay. The problems that I have been working on include: low-rank matrix recovery, variable selection, online and stochastic optimization, and active learning. My google scholar can be found here . My wife Jing Wang also works on machine learning, and she is on the job market. Preprints 1. Jie Shen , Ping Li, Huan Xu.
