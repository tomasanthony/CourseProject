 Research Publications Software CV Other Links Contact Im currently a Researcher at Facebook AI Research . I am also a Professor at University College London and an Allen Distinguished Investigator , leading the Machine Reading Lab . Before that I was a postdoc and research scientist with Andrew McCallum at UMass Amherst , a researcher at Tokyo University and DBCLS with Tsujii Junichi , and a PhD student with Ewan Klein at the University of Edinburgh . I work on teaching machines how to read and reason , in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Recently, I have been tackling these problems via forms of end-to-end differentiable program interpreters as well as adversarial regularisation. I am generally interested in deep learning, good old graphical models as well as old-school symbolic AI. Here are a few recent representative publications: Programming with a Differentiable Forth Interpreter , Bosnjak, Matko , Rocktaschel, Tim , Naradowsky, Jason and Riedel, Sebastian , Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2017 [ pdf ] [ details ] End-to-end Differentiable Proving , Rocktaschel, Tim and Riedel, Sebastian , Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2017 [ pdf ] [ details ] Adversarial Sets for Regularising Neural Link Predictors , Minervini, Pasquale , Demeester, Thomas, Rocktaschel, Tim and Riedel, Sebastian , Proceedings of the 33th Annual Conference on Uncertainty in AI (UAI) 2017 [ pdf ] [ details ] Complex Embeddings for Simple Link Prediction , Trouillon, Tho, Welbl, Johannes , Bouchard, Guillaume , Riedel, Sebastian and Gaussier, Eric , International Conference on Machine Learning 2016 [ pdf ] [ details ] See my publication , software and scholar pages for more details.
