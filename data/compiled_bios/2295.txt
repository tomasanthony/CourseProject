Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He held a Chang Jiang (Cheung Kong) Visiting Chair Professor in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2010-2016). He was an adjunct researcher at Microsoft Research Asia (1999-2007) and at Microsoft Advance Technology Center (2007-2009). He worked on high performance routers and ATM switches in IBM Networking System Division, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. His works covered a wide spectrum of topics in computer networking and communications, more recently on datacenter networking, cloud computing, big data analytics, learning optimization, IoT, blockchain technology, Internet content distribution, and network control algorithms. He made pioneering contributions in the Internet video broadcast with a system called Coolstreaming, which was credited as first large-scale Peer-to-Peer live video streaming system in the world. This work received the Test-of-Time Paper Award from IEEE INFOCOM (2015). He has been an editor or a guest editor for over a two dozen of journals and magazines, mostly in IEEE and ACM. He was the Co-TPC Chair for IEEE INFOCOM 2004. He is a Fellow of IEEE for "contribution to content distributions via the Internet". He received the Young Investigator Award from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in 2004, and the State Natural Science Award (2nd Class) in 2011. He served as a Distinguished Lecturer for IEEE Communications Society (2006-2008). He was a co-recipient for six Best Paper Awards from IEEE, and a Best System Track Paper in ACM Multimedia (2009). Bo Li received his B. Eng. (summa cum laude) and M. Eng. degrees in the Computer Science from Tsinghua University (Beijing), and the PhD. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
