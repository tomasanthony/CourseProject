 Current Projects My set of ongoing projects is rather dynamic, so that any specific list will be nearly always outdated. However, it is fair to say that much of my work revolves around the following themes: game theory in security (with forays into both physical and cyber security) and privacy (particularly health data privacy), innovation diffusion and marketing (especially with a machine learning/data mining twist), robust (especially adversarial) machine learning, computational vaccine design, and computational game theory and mechanism design.

My technical background is in Artificial Intelligence, with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan under supervision of Michael P. Wellman. Much of my work is in Multiagent Systems, at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics (especially Game Theory). I particularly enjoy applied concepts from game theory to a broad array of problems, such as optimal security resource allocation, robust machine learning, risk analysis of health data de-identification strategies, and game theoretic design of broadly neutralizing antibodies.
