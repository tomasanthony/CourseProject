Famelis, Michail	I joined DIRO as an assistant professor in January 2017. I am a member of GEODES, the software engineering research group. I work to create formal but practical techniques and methods for engineering software. To do this, I draw from disciplines such as formal verification, model-based engineering, and empirical methods. I study the context of software development and create novel techniques that use domain-specific abstractions that are supported by rigorous automation.
