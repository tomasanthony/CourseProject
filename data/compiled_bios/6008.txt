Applications should go to the CS department, not to me directly. I have written down some policies of how I run my group. Jim Whitehead has some excellent advice for contacting faculty. Although some of his points are specific to UCSC (the differential cost of foreign and native students, the exact details of how to apply), most of the rest is very valid. Books I read way too much, mostly science fiction and fantasy novels. I'll admit to reading a lot of utter trash, but I only recommend the good ones. I add books to the recommended list chronologically . I also have a perl script that collates a list by author , which includes short blurbs about some of the authors. My GoodReads profile is partial - new stuff read since around 2010, but missing most of the earlier stuff. I started a rampage a few years ago for my library, I made it through all the As but only halfway through the Bs before I lost steam...
