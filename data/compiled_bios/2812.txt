I'm a member of the program committee for the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), coordinator of the TREC Total Recall Track, past coordinator of the TREC Legal Track and Spam Track.	For twelve years I was coach of Waterloo's ACM International Collegiate Programming	Contest team, qualifying for the World Finals every year, winning one World Championship, and two North	American Championships.
