Beste Filiz Yuksel received her PhD in Computer Science from Tufts University, Boston, working with Robert Jacob. Her research was on the next generation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that detect and evaluate real-time brain signals using machine learning classification of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to build adaptable user interfaces for the general population. Her work won a Best Paper Award at ACM CHI 2016. She has also worked with Mary Czerwinski at Microsoft Research, investigating user-virtual agent interactions for the next generation of intelligent personal assistants. Beste will continue to work on building intelligent, adaptive interfaces that respond to both user cognitive and affective state in conjunction in her new Human-Computer Interaction lab.
