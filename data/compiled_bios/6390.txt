I'm a visiting professor in the Computer Science department at Haverford College, where I mentor students, teach courses, and do research. Check out my recent work (ESOP '19 draft) on statically verifying dynamic security policies.My goal is to keep users secure as they use modern systems. This is a challenging problem. Writing secure code is hard. Checking untrusted code is even harder. Developers are not always incentivized towards security. In some cases it is not always clear what security even means.
