I also advise some of the residents in the Google Brain Residents Program. I will not be taking any more visiting students, summer students or visitors at the University of Toronto. I will not be the sole advisor of any new graduate students, but I may co-advise a few graduate students with Prof. Roger Grosse or soon to be Prof. Jimmy Ba.
