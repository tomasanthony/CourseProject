Dan Roth's research interests are in the computational foundations of intelligent behavior. He develops theories and systems pertaining to intelligent behavior using a unified methodology at the heart of which is the idea that learning has a central role in intelligence. His research has contributed to major conceptual and theoretical advances in the modeling of natural language understanding, machine learning, and reasoning. In recent years he has focused on the study of machine learning and inference methods to facilitate natural language understanding and has also developed advanced machine learning based tools for natural language applications that are being used widely by the research community and commercially.
