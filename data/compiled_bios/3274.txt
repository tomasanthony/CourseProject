Kumar received the B.E. degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (formerly, University of Roorkee), India, in 1977, the M.E. degree in Electronics Engineering from Philips International Institute, Eindhoven, Netherlands, in 1979, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park, in 1982. Kumar's current research interests include data mining, high-performance computing, and their applications in Climate/Ecosystems and health care. Kumar is the Lead PI of a 5-year, $10 Million project, "Understanding Climate Change - A Data Driven Approach" , funded by the NSF's Expeditions in Computing program that is aimed at pushing the boundaries of computer science research. He also served as the Head of the Computer Science and Engineering Department from 2005 to 2015 and the Director of Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) from 1998 to 2005. His research has resulted in the development of the concept of isoefficiency metric for evaluating the scalability of parallel algorithms, as well as highly efficient parallel algorithms and software for sparse matrix factorization (PSPASES) and graph partitioning (METIS, ParMetis, hMetis). He has authored over 300 research articles, and has coedited or coauthored 10 books including two text books ``Introduction to Parallel Computing'' and ``Introduction to Data Mining'', that are used world-wide and have been translated into many languages. Kumar has served as chair/co-chair for many international conferences and workshops in the area of data mining and parallel computing, including 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (2002), and International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (2001). Kumar co-founded SIAM International Conference on Data Mining and served as a founding co-editor-in-chief of Journal of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining (an official journal of the American Statistical Association). Currently, Kumar serves on the steering committees of the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining and the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, and is series editor for the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Book Series published by CRC Press/Chapman Hall. Kumar is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, SIAM, and AAAS. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee (2013) and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Computer Science Department, University of Maryland College Park (2009). Kumar's foundational research in data mining and high performance computing has been honored by the ACM SIGKDD 2012 Innovation Award , which is the highest award for technical excellence in the field of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), and the 2016 IEEE Computer Society Sidney Fernbach Award , one of IEEE Computer Society's highest awards in high performance computing.
