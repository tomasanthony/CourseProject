 Westley Weimer Westley Weimer 4636 Beyster Building Office Hours: Mondays 2:30-3:00 for Winter 2019 (or by appointment) (check 2909 or 2733 if not in 4636) Office Phone: (734) 615-9916 Teaching and Advising In Winter 2019 I am teaching EECS 481 Software Engineering. Claire Le Goues, Zachary Fry and I have written an article explaining the CS job search process for graduate students (e.g., teaching and research statements, interviews, offers, negotations, academia and industry) and our experiences with it from 2005 to 2014. Conferences and Workshops I am co-organizing the Genetic Improvement Workshop (GI 2019), co-located with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2019) in Montreal. I encourage everyone to submit interesting work. The submission deadline is 1st February 2019. Research Projects My current main research interests relate to consciousness, time, and advancing software quality by using both static and dynamic programming language approaches. On the purely-CS side, I am particularly concerned with automatic or minimally-guided techniques that can scale and be applied easily to large, existing programs. I believe that finding bugs is insufficient, and I also work to help programmers address defects, understand programs, and program correctly. Current major research interests and areas: Medical Imaging, Consciousness and Time. I believe consciousness to be primal, relevant, inadequately explained, and amenable to experimentation: to me, it is the most interesting of the big problems. I believe the experience of consciousness over time to be a hard problem (in a sense akin to NP-Hard) in that solving it would allow us to solve most other problems. While these are not typically research problems considered in computer science, I believe they are becoming approachable through modern medical imaging and interested prospective students are encouraged to compare my thoughts on the subject to their own. Indicative Paper: Decoding the representation of code in the brain: An fMRI study of code review and expertise (distinguished paper award, ICSE 2017) Project and Dataset Webpage Automated Program Repair. We have pioneered algorithms, such as GenProg, to synthesize repairs for defects in legacy programs using only standard testcases (no code annotations or formal specifications). We use special program representations and modification operators to search through the space of candidate patches until one is found that passes all of the testcases but does not demonstrate the error. Indicative Paper: GenProg: A Generic Method for Automated Software Repair (featured article award, IEEE TSE 2012) Project and Dataset Webpage Autonomous Vehicles Sub-Project Program Analysis and Transformation. I enjoy designing, and applying, algorithms that analyze the semantics, behavior and maintainability of software. I particularly appreciate program analysis because it benefits from both formal, logical proofs as well human studies and natural language. Indicative Paper: Using Dynamic Analysis to Discover Polynomial and Array Invariants (distinguished paper award, ICSE 2012) Improving Software Properties. Beyond functional correctness, a number of other properties are important to software. Aspects as diverse as power consumption, maintainability, and visual fidelity are all important in some domains. We have developed techniques to improve or trade-off these non-functional properties in software automatically.
