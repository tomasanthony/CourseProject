Citation in the book Giants of Engineering Science by AnwarBeg, Matador, UK, 2003, for contributions in structural and geotechnicalmechanics. [ISBN: 1-899293-52-3] Giants of Engineering Science is a biographical monograph examining the life and works of ten of the worlds leading engineering scientists. The book features A. C. Eringen of Princeton University, H. S. Takhar of Manchester Metropolitan University, Theodore Wu of the California Institute of Technology, the late Richard Skalak of Columbia University and the University of California at San Diego, Y. C. Fung of the University of California at San Diego, Howard Brenner of MIT, K. J. Bathe of MIT, the late C. L. Tien of the University of California at Berkeley, W. F. Chen of the University of Hawaii and the late Howard W. Emmons of Harvard University. A thorough study of the contributions of these leading intellectuals in diverse branches of engineering is presented spanning industrial flows, continuum mechanics, biofluids, biomechanics, chemo-fluid dynamics, structural and geotechnical mechanics, fire dynamics, heat transfer, wave hydrodynamics and computational mechanics.
