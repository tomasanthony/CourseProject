Insup's research interests are in real-time, embedded, and cyber physical systems, which increasingly affect our daily lives. His research goals are to ensure and improve the correctness, safety, timeliness, trustworthiness, and compositionality of these systems. Insup has been developing techniques and tools for compositional real-time scheduling, model-based development, quantitative trust management, and run-time verification. He has also been transitioning his research results into practice by applying them to safety-critical embedded systems and high-confidence medical device systems.
