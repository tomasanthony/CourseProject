I got my PhD from Computer Science Department at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Jiawei Han . I received M.E. and B.E. from the Computer Science and Technology Department at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. For Prospective Students I am looking for motivated Ph.D. students who are interested in data mining and related areas. Please send me your CV and/or apply to CSE buffalo if you are interested. Graduate admission information can be found here . Research Interests I am broadly interested in data and information analysis with a focus on data mining. In particular, I am interested in truth discovery, crowdsourcing, knowledge graphs, multi-source data analysis, anomaly detection, information network analysis, transfer learning and data stream mining. I am also interested in various data mining applications in health care, bioinformatics, transportation, cyber security and education.
