"Too many potential physicists and engineers spend their careers shifting money around in the financial sector, instead of applying their talents to innovating in the real economy." Barack Obama, "The way ahead" , TheEconomist , 8 October 2016. "The physicist who is only a physicist can still be a first class physicist and a most valuable member of society. But nobody can be a great economist who is only an economist - and I am even tempted to add that the economist who is only an economist is likely to become a nuisance if not a positive danger."

Reviewer and editor I have reviewed 157 manuscripts for the journals listed below (about 12 per year since 2008); I have been academic editor of Advances in Complex Systems (since 2018), ISRN (2011-2017) and PLOS ONE (2011-2016); a part of these activities is documented by Publons and mirrored on ORCID. Moreover, I have reviewed for conferences, book publishers, grants and awards. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science asked me to contribute nominations for the 2012 prize. 32 Physical Review E; 23 Physical Review Letters; 10 Journal of Computational Chemistry; 7 Physica A, PLOS ONE; 6 Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical; 5 Computer Physics Communications, Journal of Chemical Physics, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter; 4 Advances in Complex Systems, European Journal of Operational Research, Modern Physics Letters B, Open Physics/Central European Journal of Physics, Quantitative Finance; 2 Energies, Economics E-Journal, International Journal of Modern Physics B, Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, Mathematics, Physics Letters A; 1 Advances in Mathematical Physics, Algorithms, Annals of Operations Research, Applied Informatics, Boundary Value Problems, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, European Physical Journal B, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, International Journal of Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, Journal of Molecular Modelling, Journal of Network Theory in Finance, Journal of Statistical Physics, Management Science, Numerical Algorithms, Oriental Journal of Chemistry, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, Physical Review A, Physical Review B, Review of Derivatives Research, Reviews of Modern Physics, Soft Materials, SpringerPlus, Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics.
