DBH 4214 shz@ics.uci.edu About Me I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine . Before joining UCI, I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT , supervised by Frdo Durand . I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University in 2014, advised by Kavita Bala . I work in computer graphics with a focus on material appearance modeling and physically-based rendering. My research aims to computationally reproduce the appearance of the real world using physically based models, allowing the prediction of object appearance under a wide range of conditions. More broadly, I am interested in modeling and solving particle (e.g., photon and neutron) transport problems under complex and realistic configurations. We draw inspirations from optics, material science, and computational statistics to develop new techniques for computer graphics & vision, industrial design, material engineering, and biomedical applications.
