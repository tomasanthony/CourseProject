Sucheta Soundarajan Assistant Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 4-127 CST [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree: PhD, Computer Science (2013, Cornell University) Research Interests: Data mining Social network analysis Community detection Applications to social and life sciences Current Research: Dr. Soundarajans research focuses on the structure of social and other real-world networks. She is interested in a variety of problems related to social network analysis, including community detection, link prediction, and network similarity. She is currently studying how communities change over time and, in particular, the structural factors that influence a communitys evolution. She is also interested in developing methods to obtain accurate samples of large network.
