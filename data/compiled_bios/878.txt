 Dr. Kovashka received her BA degrees in Computer Science and Media Studies from Pomona College, in 2008, and her PhD in Computer Science from The University of Texas in Austin, in 2014. She joined Pitt's Computer Science department in January 2015. Her primary research area is computer vision, with overlap in machine learning, information retrieval, crowdsourcing, and natural language processing. Her work examines approaches for improving image retrieval with semantic visual attributes, by ensuring that the most useful feedback is given to the retrieval system, and that the system understands correctly potentially ambiguous and subjective attribute terms. Dr. Kovashka is also interested in improving the communication between human and machine to ensure that vision systems receive rich supervision and can visualize their outputs to their human users, for debugging purposes.
