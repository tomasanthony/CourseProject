The Kundaje lab develops statistical and machine learning methods for large-scale integrative analysis of functional genomic data to decode regulatory elements and pathways across diverse cell types and tissues and understand their role in cellular function and disease. Anshul completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2008 from Columbia University. As a postdoc at Stanford University from 2008-2012 and a research scientist at MIT and the Broad Institute from 2012-2014, he led the integrative analysis efforts for two of the largest functional genomics consortia - The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Dr. Kundaje is a recipient of the 2016 NIH Directors New Innovator Award and The 2014 Alfred Sloan Foundation Fellowship. Anshul is also a member of the NIH Director's Advisory Committee for Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Research.WHAT WE DOMy primary research interests are computational biology and applied machine learningwith a focus on gene regulation.Our research focusses on development of statistical and machine learning methods for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic and genetic data to learn models of gene regulation.We have led the analysis efforts of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Projects with the development of novel methods forDenoising and normalization of large-scale functional genomic dataDissecting combinatorial transcription factor co-occupancy within and across cell-typesPredicting cell-type specific enhancers from chromatin state profilesModeling 3D genome architecture and predicting cell-type specificenhancer-promoter interactionsLearningtranscriptional regulatory networks that integrate proximal and distal cis and trans signals.Improving the detection and interpretation of potentially causal disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studiesMore recently, we have also been developingInterpretable deep learning frameworks for functional genomics and epigenomicsCausal regulatory models by integrating functional genomic data from temporal (e.g. differentiation/reprogramming) and perturbation (e.g. drug response, knockdown, genome-editing) experimentsEarly cancer detection and tissue-of-origin deconvolution from liquid biopsy (e.g. cell-free DNA) assays.Methods to understand the relationships between genetic variation, regulatory chromatin variation and expression variation in healthy and diseased individualsFor more details see our Projects.

The talk is available here.Feb 2015: A landmark set of papers from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project were released in Naturehttp://nature.com/epigenomeroadmap.Anshul was first author on theflagship paperthat provides the largest resource ofreference human epigenomesAnshul was also a co-author on another paper that used epigenomics to revealnovel mechanisms involving the immune system in Alzheimer's diseasesPress releases fromThe New York Times,The Los Angeles Times,Stanford UniversityAug 2014:Comparative ENCODE/modENCODE paperspublished in Nature.Latest releaseof uniformly processed data (TF, chromatin and transcriptome) across 3 species - worm, fly and human now available.February 2014: Anshul was awarded the prestigiousAlfred Sloan Foundation's Research Fellowship.Press releases fromThe Sloan Foundation,The New York Times,The India-West newspaperandThe Economic Times (India).BACKGROUND 2012-2013, I was a Research Scientist in Manolis Kellis' labat MIT and The Broad Institutestudying epigenomic and chromatin state dynamics across organisms, cell-types and individualsas part of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the mod/ENCODE (Encyclopedia for DNA elements) consortium. 2008 - 2012, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Serafim Batzoglou and Arend Sidowin the Computer Science Dept. at Stanford University.I served as one of the lead data coordinators and computational analysts for the ENCODE consortium. My primary focus was on deciphering heterogeneity of regulatory interactions in the human genome. I also developed ENCODE's ChIP-seq statistical data analysis pipeline. 2003-2008, I was a graduate student (PhD.) inChristina Leslie's lab in the Computer Science Dept. atColumbia University in New York.I developed Machine Learning methods for modeling transcriptional gene regulation in yeast and worm.2002-2003, I briefly worked at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in the Functional Genomics and Systems Biology group under Gustavo Stolovitzky. I developed one of the first statistical noise models for massively parallel sequencing data (MPSS) in a collaboration with The Institute of Systems Biology and Lynx Therapeutics.In a past life, I was an Electrical Engineer (B.E from Mumbai University, 2001 and M.S. from Columbia University, 2002) and worked on computer networks and voice over IP with Henning Schulzrinne.
