Check out my online machine learning class . Research Interests My main research interests are in the fields of machine learning and data mining. I'd like to make computers do more with less help from us, learn from experience, adapt effortlessly, and discover new knowledge. We need computers that reduce the information overload by extracting the important patterns from masses of data. This poses many deep and fascinating scientific problems: How can a computer decide autonomously which representation is best for target knowledge? How can it tell genuine regularities from chance occurrences? How can pre-existing knowledge be exploited? How can a computer learn with limited computational resources? How can learned results be made understandable by us? My research addresses these and related questions. Research topics that I'm working on, or have recently worked on, include: Learning concepts represented by sets of rules Using examples as implicit definitions of concepts Using probabilistic representations and analyses to address the uncertainty inherent in learning Automating the process of selecting representations for concepts Learning several models and combining them to improve accuracy and stability Evaluating and selecting candidate models to avoid "overfitting" (i.e., to distinguish between genuine regularities and chance occurrences) Learning models that can be easily understood by people Using pre-existing knowledge to guide and improve learning Developing knowledge discovery algorithms that run in linear or near-linear time, and so scale up to large databases Using subsampling techniques to scale up pre-existing approaches Developing algorithms that take into account the costs of decisions Understanding the probabilistic properties and foundations of data mining algorithms Developing techniques for mining semi-structured data sources (e.g., text, the Web) Current Projects Statistical Relational Learning: Learning from noisy data in rich representations Tractable Deep Learning: Learning deep models where inference is tractable Machine Reading: Extracting knowledge bases from text Collective Knowledge Bases: Merging knowledge from a multitude of sources Large-Scale Machine Learning: Mining massive data streams Brief Bio I'm a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington and the author of The Master Algorithm . I'm a winner of the SIGKDD Innovation Award, the highest honor in data science, and a AAAI Fellow. I've received an NSF CAREER Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Fulbright Scholarship, an IBM Faculty Award, several best paper awards, and other distinctions. I received an undergraduate degree (1988) and M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1992) from IST, in Lisbon. I received an M.S. (1994) and Ph.D. (1997) in Information and Computer Science from the University of California at Irvine. I spent two years as an assistant professor at IST, before joining the faculty of the University of Washington in 1999. I'm the author or co-author of over 200 technical publications in machine learning, data mining, and other areas. I'm a member of the editorial board of the Machine Learning journal, co-founder of the International Machine Learning Society, and past associate editor of JAIR. I was program co-chair of KDD-2003 and SRL-2009, and I've served on the program committees of AAAI, ICML, IJCAI, KDD, NIPS, SIGMOD, UAI, WWW, and others.
