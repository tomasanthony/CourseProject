 Tawanna Dillahunt Tawanna Dillahunt Menu Skip to content HomePublications Teaching Team News Prospective Students Contact Me Lower Menu Skip to content About me I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigans School of Information (UMSI) and hold a courtesy appointment with theElectrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department. Before starting as an Assistant Professor,I was a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow in UMSI from January 2013 July 2014. I also lead the Social Innovations Groupat UMSI and I am a member of theMichigan ICTDand Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) groups. My research spans Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing fields. I am primarily interested in identifying needs and opportunities to further explore how theories from the social sciences can be used to design technologies that have a positive impact on group and individual behavior.With the narrowing of the digital divide, the ubiquity of smart devices and mobile hotspots in common places in the U.S. (e.g., libraries, community centers, and even McDonalds) I see an urgent need to explore the use of these technologies for those that stand the most to gain from these resources. Therefore,I design, build, enhance and deploy innovative technologies that solve real-world problems, particularly in underserved communities. I hold a M.S. and Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University,a M.S. in Computer Science from the Oregon Graduate Institute School of Science and Engineering (now a part of the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, OR), and aB.S. in Computer Engineering from North Carolina State University. I was also a software engineer at Intel Corporation for several years. See my CV for details. Proudly powered by WordPress
