 Lei Jiao's Home Page at University of Oregon Toggle navigation Lei Jiao Home Publications Teaching Services Team Activities I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science , University of Oregon . I worked at Nokia Bell Labs in Dublin, Ireland previously, and held a permanent position of Member of Technical Staff in 2016. I received the Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) degree in computer science (Informatik) from University of Gttingen ( Georg-August-Universitt Gttingen ) in Germany in 2014. I also worked as a Researcher at IBM Research in Beijing, China in 2010. I am broadly interested in the mathematical and algorithmic sciences for systems and networks. I explore optimization, control, and mechanism design to drive the intelligent management of large-scale distributed computing and communication infrastructures and services. Focusing on cloud and edge, I have been working on a range of problems, including resource allocation, service placement, workload scheduling, data caching, energy efficiency, and incentives/payment.
