I am also a faculty member in UCSB's Media Arts and Technology Program . My research interests lie in the area of human-computer interaction and experimental systems. I am particularly interested in novel user interfaces that depart in interesting ways from the normal desktop setting. This includes such fields as augmented reality, virtual reality and other 3D user interfaces; interactive visualization and real-time computer graphics; 3D displays; wearable, situated, ubiquitous, and social computing; adaptive user interfaces; and multi-modal and multimedia computing.
