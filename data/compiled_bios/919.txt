Paul earned a BA and an MEng, both in CS, from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York .

He was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2004. Paul has twice been awarded the University of Toronto Students' Union/Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students (2005, 2011), and received the Faculty of Arts and Science Outstanding Teaching Award in 2006, the University of Toronto President's teaching award in 2011, and the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA) Teaching Award in 2012. At various points in his life Paul was captain of Yoghurt Culture (a summer-league soccer team back in high school), sang tenor in the Cornell University Glee Club, performed in a couple of Gilbert and Sullivan shows with the Cornell Savoyards, and batted .751 with the U of T CS summer softball team back when he was much younger. These days, Paul enjoys singing, good scotch, and intermittent sword fighting with the SCA, and has been known to enjoy good wine even though "wine" doesn't begin with an "s". He golfs as rarely as possible.
