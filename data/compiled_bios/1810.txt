He holds an Electrical Engineer degree from CPE-Lyon, France (2008), a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from INSA Lyon, France (2008) and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France and the University of Lyon, France (2011). Prior to joining the University of Utah, he was a research associate at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland within the Laboratory of Integrated Systems (Prof. De Micheli) and a visiting research associate at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA. Previously, he was research assistant at CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France. Prof. Gaillardon is recipient of the C-Innov 2011 best thesis award, the Nanoarch 2012 best paper award, the BSF 2017 Prof. Pazy Memorial Research Award, the 2017 NSF CAREER award and the 2018 IEEE CEDA Pederson Award. He has been serving as TPC member for many conferences, including DATE'15-19, DAC'16-18, Nanoarch'12-17, and is reviewer for several journals and funding agencies. He served as Topic co-chair "Emerging Technologies for Future Memories" for DATE'17-19. He is a senior member of the IEEE. The research activities and interests of Prof. Gaillardon are currently focused on the development of novel computing systems exploiting emerging device technologies and novel EDA techniques. Open Positions Dr. Gaillardon constantly encourages prospective PhD and MSc/Bsc students to apply to his research group at the University of Utah. The LNIS laboratory is also currently looking for Post-Doc researchers in the fields of EDA, nanofabrication, embedded systems and chip design. Dr. Gaillardon research is located on the boundary between emerging device technologies, digital design and design automation. Projects are carried out in an interdisciplinary team with a wide range of competences and in close collaboration with other labs and partners.
