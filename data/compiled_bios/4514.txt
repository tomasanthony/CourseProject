 Qirun Zhang Assistant Professor School of Computer Science Georgia Institute of Technology Office: Klaus Advanced Computing Building 2324 Email: qrzhang@gatech.edu [ Research Interests ] [ Publications ] [ Projects ] [ Course ] [ Service ][ Misc ] [ Contact ] I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2013, and I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University in 2009. I am always looking for motivated and talented students to work with. If you are interested, please contact me . Research Interests My research interests are in the areas of programming languages and software engineering, specifically focusing on techniques for improving software reliability and security. In particular, I enjoy working on program analysis and compiler optimization problems from perspectives such as computational complexity, analytic combinatorics, graph theory, and formal languages.
