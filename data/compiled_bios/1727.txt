Mailing Address: Clark Verbrugge Associate Professor School of Computer Science, McGill University McConnell Engineering Bldg., Rm. 318 3480 University Street Montral, Qubec, Canada H3A0E9 Courses for the 2018-2019 Academic Year Winter 2019: COMP 409 Concurrent Programming . Fall 2018: COMP 521 Modern Computer Games . Research Interests I am interested in several research areas. If you are student with some interest in one or other of these topics, check out the "Prospective" tab and contact me. Modern computer games I am interested in various topics, generally centered around the idea of formalizing aspects of game play. This includes game analysis and player modelling, as well as applications, such as in procedural content generation, narrative design, and tools for the analysis and design of games. For more information, including publications, technical reports, and student theses, see the GR@M website. Compilers and Languages Much of my research work has focused on compiler analysis and optimization, especially in the context of concurrent computing. I have a current interest in language design and optimization aimed at machine learning applications, especially in the context of hardware acceleration. Publications, including technical reports, and student theses in the general area of compilers can be found on the Sable Research Group website. Web Languages An area I would like to expand is on optimizing and designing programming languages and environments used in web applications. I am particularly interested in wiki design, and more generally on PHP and JavaScript. Publications I mainly target conferences, rather than journals. I do not have convenient links to all publications, particularly the older ones. If you are interested in an article, feel free to email me. Also note that other than a few older ones I have not included technical reports in this list. Accepted and in-press Jonathan Campbell, Clark Verbrugge.

Prospective Students I am always interested in hearing from students interested in working with me. I do read everything, but I observe in myself a response time that is positively related to the effort required to formulate a response, and inversely related to the effort I see invested in the original request. Do not be shy about sending reminder emails either, as it is possible I have forgotten. For PhD students, please include details on your research interests/plan/background. It is important that your interests mesh with mine, so be clear on how your research goals would fit within my areas of interest. For MSc students, you do not necessarily need to contact me first or propose any particular research goal. I would be happy to be notified of your interest, and I would be happy to talk to you in person once you are admitted. Here is a link to general admission information for students interested in studying Computer Science or Software Engineering at McGill University, and here is a link to information on graduate studies in CS .
