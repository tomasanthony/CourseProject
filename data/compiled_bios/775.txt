I am a Chicago native and a former DePaul student. I started working in IT after I completed the DePaul CPP program in 1986-87. I then went on to take two additional continuing education programs, the C++ and the .Net Developer program. I ran a small financial software company in Chicago from 1999 to 2010. I started working with Content Management systems in 2000, and since then I have been doing as much as I can with anything CMS.
