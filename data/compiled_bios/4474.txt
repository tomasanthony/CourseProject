 Case Western Reserve University Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) About Us : Research : People : Publications : Teaching : Sponsors : Contact Us Welcome: BioMicroSystems Laboratory was founded in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH in August 2005 by Professor Pedram Mohseni. The research activities of the laboratory lie in the fields of biomicrosystems, implantable neuroprostheses, wireless brain-machine interfaces, microelectronics for neural engineering, and wireless integrated sensing/actuating systems. In particular, we aim to employ engineering techniques to investigate the function and manipulate the behavior of the nervous system in both electrical and chemical paradigms, with the ultimate goal of enabling the investigation of brain-behavior relationships in neurobiology and restoring human function via direct interactions between the nervous system and state-of-the-art engineered devices.
