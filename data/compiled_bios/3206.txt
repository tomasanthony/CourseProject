 Rajesh Ranganath About Papers Teaching Contact About I am an Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute at NYU in Computer Science and at the Center for Data Science (affiliate). I am also part of the CILVR group. My research interests center on easy-to-use probablistic inference, understanding the role of randomness and information in model building, and machine learning for healthcare. Before joining NYU, I completed my PhD at Princeton working with Dave Blei and my undergraduate at Stanford both in computer science. I have also spent time as a research affiliate at MITs Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.
