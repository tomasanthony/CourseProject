My research is in the area of activity and plan recognition; my Ph.D. thesis was on multi-agent plan recognition and focused on the problem of recognizing tactical team plans from spatio-temporal traces of military teams in urban settings. I am lead editor of a book ( Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition: Theory and Practice ) on this topic. My work on activity recognition has focused primarily on the following domains: adversarial games assistive technologies human-robot interactions cooperation in multi-agent systems software support for human teams My area of expertise is AI and machine learning, primarily in the context of multi-agent and multi-robot systems. For a synopsis of my group's work, please check out my talk on Data-driven Social Informatics . To find out about me and other women STEM faculty at UCF, check out this interview . I was also interviewed for an overview on AI by the Florida High Tech magazine. Graduate research applicants to my group should have prior experience in one of the following areas: multi-agent systems, machine learning, probabilistic graphical models, social media analysis, games/simulations, or robotics.

(AAMAS 2020) Reviewer, Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems ( JAAMAS ) Biography I joined the faculty of computer science at University of Central Florida, Orlando in fall 2007. I received my Ph.D. from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, an M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon, and an A.B. in psychology from Princeton University. Between my masters and Ph.D., I worked as a researcher at Compaq Research/HP Labs (CRL) in the handheld computing group. Outside of work, I practice martial arts and have a shodan (1st degree black belt) in Shotokan Karate . I also have an advanced PADI diver certification and have recently completed my 200th dive. My husband (and diving buddy), Dr. Rahul Sukthankar , is a researcher in computer vision at Google Research.
