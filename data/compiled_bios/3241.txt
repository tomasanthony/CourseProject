 Shahriar Nirjon is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Shahriar is interested in building practical cyber-physical systems that involve embedded sensors and mobile devices, mobility and connectivity, and mobile data analytics. Research challenges that he deals with include practical issues in physical world sensing, user-contexts and mobility, real-time issues, and resource constraints of the embedded platform. His work has applications in the area of remote health and wellness monitoring, and mobile health. Shahriar received his Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville in 2014. Shahriar has won a number of awards, including two Best Paper Awards, at the Mobile Systems, Applications and Services (MOBISYS 2014), and the Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2012). Shahriar has worked as a Research Scientist in the Networking and Mobility Lab at the Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, CA (2014 2015), and as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA (Summer 2013) and at Deutsche Telekom Lab, Los Altos, CA (Summer 2010). Several of his work have been highlighted in the electronic and print media, including the Economist, the New Scientist, and the BBC.
