 Dr Denise Gorse Member of the Financial Computing and Analytics group Research Current research centres mostly in the area of financial computing, with past work in bioinformatics (methods for predicting local protein structure, repeating motifs, interface regions in multi-subunit complexes) and on novel methods for global minimisation (chaperone-based techniques for finding nativelike states of heteropolymer energy functions; smoothing transformations for avoiding local minima in neural network training). Pre-2000 work focused on hardware-realisable stochastic neural networks as part of the UCL/KCL team that developed the pRAM (probabilistic random access memory) chip.
