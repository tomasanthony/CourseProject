 Mahesh Balakrishnan m#ah#e#sh at cs dot yale dot edu (minus hashes) // AKW 308A, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511-8937 I am an Associate Professor (pre-tenure) in the Department of Computer Science at Yale University. I work in the union of distributed systems, storage, and networking. I was previously at VMware Research until May 2015, and before that at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley until Nov 2014. I got my PhD at Cornell University in 2009 while working with Ken Birman on reliable communication protocols for data centers. At Yale, I am a member of the Computer Systems Lab . I am spending the 2017 and 2018 academic years on leave at Facebook. My work is funded by an NSF AitF grant , Facebook Faculty Awards (2015 and 2016), and a VMWare Early Career Faculty Grant (2017) .
