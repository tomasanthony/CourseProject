Modelics is a scientific laboratory dedicated to the modeling of engineering and living complex systems. Modelics is led by Prof. Piero Triverio at the University of Toronto. Learn more about our research , teaching , open positions , and facilities ! Research/ Signal Integrity & EMC Interference can be a critical issue in electronic products, from smartphones to airplanes! We invent new methods to address signal integrity and EMC issues. Our expertise is available to Canadian and international companies through partnerships and research contracts. Research/ Mathematical Modeling and Simulation Simulation techniques are nowadays strategic in many fields, but many real life problems are simply too complex for existing simulators. We invent new math to tackle them, pushing the boundaries of what mathematics can do to improve our daily life . Our simulation techniques find application in electronic design, antennas, and medicine. Research/ Power Systems Faults and lightning phenomena can threaten the distribution of energy to our cities, causing large blackouts. We develop better models and simulation techniques to help power companies predict such events, and design reliable power networks. Check out MoM-SO, our state-of-the-art method for power cable modeling! Awards Our research received several international awards! Find out more here ! Facilities The Electromagnetics group operates state-of-the-art laboratories, including: 67 GHz 8-port VNA for signal and power integrity, 6 m EMC chamber, mm-wave chamber, near field scanner, 7 m antenna range.
