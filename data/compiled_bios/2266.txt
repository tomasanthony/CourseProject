Mathematics 2002-2006 Current Position Chuan Huang, Ph.D. currently is an Assistant Professor in Radiology Research and Psychiatry at Stony Brook Medicine. Research Chuan Huang's research interests include Simultaneous PET/MRI, Medical Imaging Reconstruction/Analysis, Quantitative Methods for Medical Imaging, Rapid MRI. His PhD research focused on image analysis/reconstruction and parametric MRI. He developed a radial FSE technique to obtain the T2 map for the entire brain within 2 minutes of acquisition time. In 2012, Dr. Huang extended his research interest into simultaneous PET/MRI. Dr. Huang is the first author of the first paper on MR microcoil based PET motion correction for head; this work was featured in a press release of the 2013 annual meeting of SNMMI. Dr. Huang had been leading the MR effort of the simultaneous PET/MRI projects during his stay in the Center of Advanced Medical Imaging Sciences at Massachusetts General Hospital.
