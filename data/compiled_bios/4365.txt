 David A. Naumann Professor of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology . Here's contact info and Curriculum Vitae . Publications etc. Teaching Fall 2018 - CS 115 Introduction to Computer Science, and CS 643 Formal Verification of Software Fall 2017 -- on sabbatical as Visiting Fellow at Princeton University, in the DeepSpec project Spring 2017 -- CS 182 Introduction to Computer Science Honors II Fall 2016 -- CS 810B Formal Modeling and Analysis for Software Security, and CS 485 Societal Impact of Information Technologies Spring 2016 -- CS 182 Introduction to Computer Science Honors II Fall 2015 -- CS 115 Introduction to Computer Science and CS 135 Discrete Structures Spring 2015 -- CS 496/510 Principles of Programming Languages Assistantships For undergrad and MS students: Scholarships for Service . Undergraduate summer research: Contact me early in Spring semester for projects, supported by NSF and the Stevens Scholars program. And look for other opportunities and ideas . PhD positions: From time to time I take on new PhD students for research on secure information flow in software: policies, static analysis, and runtime monitoring for Android and other platforms. Full funding is provided. The ideal candidates have background in programming language theory and implementation or formal methods. Research My focus is on formal methods and software security, including: ad hoc network application security; JavaScript and web security; fine-grained confidentiality/integrity policies; program analysis, verification, and transformation; correctness by construction; and methodology for formal specification of system components. For details see publications and tools . Affiliated with: CASSIA, the Center for the Advancement of Secure Systems and Information Assurance ; also the DeepSpec project. Recent postdoctoral research associate: Mounir Assaf, working on Hyperproperty Abstraction for Information Flow Control funded by NSF EAGER award CCF-1649884. Current and past PhD students: Mohammad Nikouei; Andrey Chudnov (finished Spring 2016); Chunyu Tang (finished Fall 2013); Stan Rosenberg (finished Summer 2011); Qi Sun (finished Fall 2007). I'm working on Relational Verification for Information Assurance and Privacy (NSF award SaTC CNS-1718713). I worked with Anindya Banerjee ( IMDEA Software ), Gary Leavens (U. Central FL.), and others on Flexible and Practical Information Flow Assurance for Mobile Apps (NSF award 1228930) --see the FlowSpecs project . With support from DHS I worked on Tunable Information Flow with researchers at HRL Laboratories . I work with Gary Leavens and others on the Java Modeling Language (JML) , and with Leila Silva (UFS Brazil), Giovanny Lucero (UFS Brazil), and Augusto Sampaio (UFPE Brazil) on refactoring (NSF awards CNS-0708330 and CCF-0915611). With support from Microsoft Research I worked with Andy Gordon and FranoisDupressoir on verifying cryptographic code in C, and collaborated on the Spec#/Boogie software specification/verification project. With support from NSF I worked with Anindya Banerjee on Access Control and Downgrading in Information Flow Assurance , collaborating with Tamara Rezk and Gilles Barthe (INRIA), Marco Pistoia (IBM), Qi Sun and Stan Rosenberg. See our Secure Information Flow Inferencer and Verifier for Region Logic . With support from Telcordia and the U.S. Government I worked with Susanne Wetzel and Chunyu Tang on high assurance for security in wireless networking.
