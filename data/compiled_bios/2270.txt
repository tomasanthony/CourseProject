[About Me] [Publications] [Awards] [Teaching] [Projects] About Me I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I am also affiliated with Department of Computer Science and Smart Energy Technology Cluster. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the California Institute of Technology , where I was co-advised by Prof. Adam Wierman and Prof. Steven Low . Before Caltech, I received my M.S. degree of Computer Science & Technology in 2009 and B.E. degree of Measurement & control in 2006, both from Tsinghua University with honor. I also received a dual degree of Economics from Peking University in 2009. Here is my Curriculum Vitae . My current research interests include cloud computing, online convex optimization, energy-efficient computing, machine learning, internet of things, market design, distributed control. My research combines rigorous analysis and system design, and goes from theory, to prototype, and eventually to industry to make real impacts.
