 Iman Marvian Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Iman Marvian completed his PhD in Physics in October 2012 at the University of Waterloo and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. He worked at the University of Southern California (Nov 2012-Aug 2015) and MIT (Sept 2015-Dec 2017) as postdoctoral researcher. His main research interest is quantum information and computation theory. He has worked on a wide range of topics in this field, including quantum algorithms, quantum error suppression, open quantum systems, quantum resource theories and quantum thermodynamics. Also, he is very interested in finding applications for ideas and techniques developed in quantum information theory in the rest of physics.
