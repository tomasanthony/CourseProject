Ian Goldberg	Ian Goldberg	Professor and University Research Chair	Cheriton School of Computer	Science	University of Waterloo	200 University Ave W	Waterloo, Ontario, Canada	N2L 3G1	Office: DC 3518	Phone: 519-888-4567 x36168	Research	I am a faculty member in the Cryptography,	Security, and Privacy (CrySP) group,	in the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute,	and in the Centre for Applied	Cryptographic Research (CACR). I am also an affiliate faculty member in	the Systems and Networks	group, and an affiliate member of the Institute for Quantum Computing.	My main research interests are in the areas of security and privacy, and	specifically in creating privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) for the	Internet.	I organize the CrySP	Speaker Series on Privacy.
