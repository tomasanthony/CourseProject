Details Link Biography Bo An is an Associate Professor and Assistant Chair (Innovation) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering of the Nanyang Technological University . He was a Nanyang Assistant Professor during 2014-2018. Prior to join NTU in 2013, he spent one year as an Associate Professor at the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences . During October 2010 to June 2012, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Southern California , working with Professor Milind Tambe . He received the Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst , where he was advised by Professor Victor Lesser . Prior to that, he received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Chongqing University, China. His research interests include artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, game theory, automated negotiation, resource allocation, and optimization. He has published over 90 referred papers at top conferences (AAMAS, IJCAI, AAAI, ICAPS, WWW, and KDD) and journals (JAAMAS, AIJ and ACM/IEEE Transactions). His research results in complex resource allocation have been applied to e-commerce, sensor networks, distributed streaming processing systems, and cloud computing. His work on applying game theory to security has been applied to develop game-theoretic randomization software that is currently deployed by the United States Federal Air Marshals Service, the United States Coast Guard, and wildlife conservation organizations. He has served as program committee members for many top conferences (e.g., AAMAS, IJCAI, AAAI) and was co-chair for some key international conferences/symposia. He is the recipient of the 2010 IFAAMAS Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award, an Operational Excellence Award from the Commander, First Coast Guard District of the United States, the 2012 INFORMS Daniel H. Wagner Prize for Excellence in Operations Research Practice, and 2018 Nanyang Research Award (Young Investigator). His publications won the Best Innovative Application Paper award at AAMAS'12 and the Innovative Application Award at IAAI'16. He was invited to give Early Career Spotlight talk at IJCAI'17. He led the team HogRider which won the 2017 Microsoft Collaborative AI Challenge. He was named to IEEE Intelligent Systems' "AI's 10 to Watch" list for 2018. He is a member of the editorial board of Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) and the Associate Editor of Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems (JAAMAS), IEEE Intelligent Systems, and ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology. He was elected to the board of directors of IFAAMAS and senior member of AAAI.
