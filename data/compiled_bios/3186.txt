 He He ( How to pronounce? ) Gates 254 Stanford University hehe@cs.stanford.edu [ CV ] [ Google Scholar ] I am an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services, Palo Alto. Starting Fall 2019, I will be joining NYU CS as an assistant professor. Previously, I was a post-doc at Stanford University working with Percy Liang . I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park , advised by Hal Daum III and Jordan Boyd-Graber . I am broadly interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I want to enable machines to communicate with people in a natural, efficient way. Towards this goal, my research focuses on language understanding in an interactive environment. Recent directions include dialogue systems and controllable text generation. Prospective students: I am looking for students to join my group next Fall. Please apply to either the PhD program in Computer Science or PhD program in Data Science .
