 About News Publications Contact Alexandros Daglis Assistant Professor Georgia Tech ABOUT I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgia Tech . My research focuses on rack-scale computing and network-compute integration, targeting the most challenging communication-intensive services with tight latency targets in datacenter environments. Blurring the boundaries between network and compute, and pushing functionality with richer semantics to the network endpoints paves the way for high-performance, efficient and scalable microsecond-scale services. I am also broadly interested in the ongoing transition from CPU-centric to network- and memory-centric computing and the impact of this paradigm shift in the evolution of system architectures, algorithms, and software. Before joining Georgia Tech, I obtained my PhD at EPFL under the supervision of Babak Falsafi and Edouard Bugnion . I was the architect of Scale-Out NUMA , a rack-scale architecture, programming model and communication protocol designed to deliver low-latency and high-bandwidth access to remote memory, enabling memory pooling in scale-out deployments. My thesis entitled Network-Compute Co-Design for Distributed In-Memory Computing was awarded an EPFL thesis distinction and has been nominated for an ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award by EPFL's Department of Computer and Communication Sciences.
