I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, where I teach intro CS, software development, computer networks, and distributed systems. I am also the Academic Director of the Masters Program in Computer Science. I am involved in a number of other activities on campus, such as being the faculty advisor to the departments student organizations and coaching our ICPC teams. I am not actively involved in research at the moment, but my research has primarily focused on resource allocation on distributed systems using virtualization. I have published a number of papers on those subjects and, more recently, I have also published some papers on Computer Science Education.                                                           2018         Powered by the       Academic theme for       Hugo.
