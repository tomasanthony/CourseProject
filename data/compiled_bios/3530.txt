Laurent El Ghaoui: Contact Information 421 Sutardja Dai Hall elghaoui@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Control, Intelligent Systems, and Robotics (CIR) Robust and convex optimization; Decision-making under uncertainty; Statistical estimation; Air traffic management; Bioinformatics; Finance . Research Centers Berkeley Center for New Media (BCNM) Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR) . . Biography I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) in 1985, and obtained my Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in March 1990. I was a faculty member at the Ecole Nationale Suprieure de Techniques Avances (Paris, France) from 1992 until 1999 and held part-time teaching appointments at Ecole Polytechnique in the Applied Mathematics Department and at Universit de Paris-I (La Sorbonne) in the Mathematics in Economy Program. In 1998, I was awarded the Bronze Medal for Engineering Sciences, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France. I joined the UC Berkeley faculty in April 1999 as an Acting Associate Professor, and obtained my tenure in May 2001. I was on leave from UC from July 2003 to 2006 to work for SAC Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York and Connecticut. .
