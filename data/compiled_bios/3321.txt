 Dr. Mark Heinrich Mark Heinrich Associate Professor, CS School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Mailing Address: Computer Science Dept, University of Central Florida 4000 Central Florida Blvd. Orlando, FL 32816-2362 Email: heinrich@cs.ucf.edu Office: CSB 252 Phone: (407) 823-5341 Fax: (407) 823-5419 Research Interests Computer architecture, parallel computer architecture, active memory and I/O systems, scalable cache coherence protocols, system-area networks, multiprocessor simulation methodology, and hardware/software co-design. Bio Started at UCF as an Associate Professor in January, 2003. Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University , a co-founder of its Computer Systems Laboratory , and a member of the Intelligent Information Systems Institute . I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University under John Hennessy in 1998 where I was a principal designer of the FLASH multiprocessor ; the author of FlashLite, the system-level simulator of the FLASH machine; and the designer of four cache coherence protocols for FLASH (bitvector/coarsevector, dynamic pointer allocation, SCI, and a 2-bit protocol). I received my MS from Stanford in 1993, and my BSE in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Duke University in 1991. I was also the co-founder and Chief Architect of Flashbase, Inc. an Internet company specializing in automated sweepstakes and database-backed forms and tools for customer acquisition. Oh, I am a HUGE sports fan. When I'm not browsing ESPN's Sportszone , I'm usually checking out Duke sports news at Duke Basketball Report .
