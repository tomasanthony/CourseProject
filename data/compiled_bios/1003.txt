Betcke Lecturer University College London Dept. of Computer Science Gower Street London WC1E 6BT United Kingdom Office: 3.08 Front Engineering Building Tel: +44 (0)20 7679 4355 (Direct Dial) Internal: 34355 Fax: +44 (0)20 7387 1397 Email: M.Betcke (at) ucl.ac.uk I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University College London. I am also a member of Centre for Inverse Problems and Centre for Medical Image Computing. Between 2010 and 2013, I held an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship "Image Reconstruction: the Sparse Way" at UCL to investigate the implications of sparsity on image acquisition and reconstruction in different modalities . Beforecoming to UCL in the end of 2009, I was a PDRA in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester working on novel X-ray CT scanners for airport baggage screening. My interest is in broad areas of Inverse Problems, Numerical Analysis andScientificComputing. In particular innumerical solution of inverse problems, tomographic image reconstruction, compressed sensing, sparsity and compression and appliedharmonic analysis. I enjoy working on novel imaging technologies andtheirapplications with focus on experimental design and reconstruction problem . What's up? PhD studentship in Imaging Foot and Ankle Dynamics .
