Heffernan I am a Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the Computer Science Department . I direct the new Ph.D. and Master's programs in Learning Sciences and Technologies . We have recently hired Jacob Whitehill and Erin Ottmar . WPI plans to hire in data science and CS again this year. Our program also plans to hire a tenure track statistician who cares about Causal Inference and experimental design. I have expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Educational Data Mining,Experimental Design,Psychometricsand the CognitiveScience ofMathematicalCognition (i.e., the study of how students learn mathematics). I have written 60+ papers on learner analytics (using data to predict some outcome in education) and over two dozen papers reporting the results on randomized controlled trials . These two areas are now starting to merge, as we apply learner analytics to more and more randomized controlled trials. I advise students in a variety of departments, including: Computer Science, Data Science , Learning Sciences and Technologies, and IMGD (e.g. educational games). Ryan Baker and I ran a Longitudinal Data Mining Competition, with 75 competing researchers. Dr. Baker and I collaborated with the competition winners to run a workshop at the EDM conference in Buffalo in summer 2018. We will hold a follow up workshop at the upcoming Pittsburgh EDM meeting . ASSISTments & Research Related Issues I am well-known for the web-based system I created called ASSISTments . ASSISTments has been featured by the New York Times and other reputable media outlets. Read about my work under the Press link. On December 7, 2016, I gave a talk at the White House about the results of the ASSISTments platform. invited to the White House to present upon the results of ASSISTments. Based on the results of many replication studies, ASSISTments is proven to be 'highly effective' time and time again. Please read more about the ASSISTments replication studies. I am proud to share the results of an efficacy trial conducted by SRI of ASSISTments. The researchers showed that ASSISTments caused 75% more student gains than the control group in a typical year. You can learn more about this study here . This video explains the results from the efficacy trial of ASSISTments conducted by SRI and published in an AERA Open journal article . YouTube Video Most folks think that ASSISTments is a great public service, and it is, but a less understood aspect of ASSISTments is it's also used as a shared scientific instrument. Click here or here for pieces I wrote about the importance of shared scientific instruments.In October 2016, I gave a talk at the White house about shared scientific instruments. Here is what I prepared ahead of time and shared with the groups. With the funding of the NSF, ASSISTments has been used,in partnership with a dozen other universities, as a sharedscientificinstrumenttoconduct randomized controlledtrials. See the se examples here. If you want to propose arandomizedcontrolled trial to do inside ASSISTments, learn more here . We remove any information from datasets that identifies individual students. You can accessto all of our data here . Teaching: I n addition to his AI research and work with the ASSISTments Foundation, Dr. Heffernan teaches several undergraduate and graduate courses at WPI. These courses include but are not limited to: Artificial Intelligence for Adaptive Educational Technology ( CS 568) . User Modeling , which focuses on educational data mining ( CS 565) . Special Topics: Online Education ( CS 525 ). Introduction to Artificial Intelligence ( CS 4341 ). Other stuff: I direct multiple grant-funded projects spending about a million dollars a year. The ASSISTments team just released docASSIST , a Google docs add-on. The ASSISTments team has also just released a Google App for Google Classroom to make it easy for schools tointegrate ASSISTments into the classroom.
