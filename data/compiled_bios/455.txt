[01/2016] Our paper on attacks against power grid electricity generation control system is accepted to ICCPS'16. In this work, we really attacked a generator of a microgrid to deviate the 50Hz system frequency. [12/2015] Story about my research: ADSC's Cybersecurity Research Tackles Big Smart Grid Problems ( Illinois version ) Research Interests I am interested in understanding how the physical ambients affect the cyber systems (e.g., sensor networks, wearables, data centers, etc) and exploiting certain properties of the physical ambients to improve the performance and resilience of the cyber systems. My ongoing research topics include: Resilient CPS/IoT system functions (e.g., timing, synchronization, location, etc) Low-power wide area networks Thermal and energy control in data centers Deep learning for sensing Power grid control system security Publication Names underlined are students, research staff, visiting students/scholars who worked directly with me in my group for the publication. 2019 On Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Learning for Internet-of-Things Objects.
