 Vincenzo Liberatore Associate Professor, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science Contact Information: Office Location: Glennan 517A Phone Number: 216.368.4089 Email: vxl11@case.edu Website: http://eida.case.edu/ Education: Ph.D., Computer Science, Rutgers University, 1998 M.S., Computer Science, Rutgers University, 1994 Laurea, Electrical Engineering, Universit di Roma La Sapienza, 1992 Research and Publications Research Interests: Dr. Liberatores research interests include real-time network control of the smart power grid of alternative energy sources, actuator and wireless sensor networks. With the support of FirstEnergy, he developed the Energy Information Dashboard (EIDA) energy market simulations as an education tool on the path from electricity generation, consumptions and markets for the smart grid. His other research interests include distributed systems, Internet computing and randomized algorithms. Dr. Liberatore served on the program committees of the Workshop on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS) and the International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM). Recent Publications: Z.
