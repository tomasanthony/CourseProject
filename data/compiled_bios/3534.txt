T. Kenneth Gustafson: Contact Information 265M Cory Hall tel: 510-642-3139 tkg@eecs.berkeley.edu : Research Areas Solid-State Devices; Basic electromagnetic and quantum applications . . . Biography He received both his BASc and MASc degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver and a Ph.D. from MIT, 1968. His thesis focused on nonlinear optical light pulse propagation and included initial work on self-steepening of light pulses, self-phase modulation, and thermodynamic implications of such interactions. While at MIT he was a consultant with Lincoln Laboratory. Following graduation, Professor Gustafson joined EECS at UC Berkeley where he continued work on nonlinear optical pulse propagation and, in particular, suggested the external self-phase modulation for the compression of optical pulses. Other work included coherent pulse probe measurements of the rotational Raman structure of molecular gases and the utilization of tunneling structures for coherent optical detection. Currently Dr. Gustafson is a fellow of the Optical Society of America and a member of the American Physical Society and the IEEE. His recent interests have included possible applications of coherent electron-hole interactions in semiconductors and quantum fluctuations in optical devices and communications systems. Professor Gustafson currently teaches EE 117: Electromagnetic Fields and Waves. . . Selected Publications G. A. Sefler, T. K. Gustafson, E. Yin, and A.
