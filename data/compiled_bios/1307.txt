Mathias Payer Assistant Professor of Computer Science Joined department: Fall 2014 Mathias Payer is a security researcher and an assistant professor in computer science at 	Purdue university leading the 	HexHive group. His interests are related to system security, binary exploitation, user-space software-based fault isolation, binary translation/recompilation, and (application) virtualization. His research focuses on protecting applications even in the presence of vulnerabilities, with a focus on memory corruption. 	 	Before joining Purdue in 2014 he spent two years as PostDoc in Dawn Song's 	BitBlaze group at 	UC Berkeley. He graduated from ETH Zurich with a 	Dr. sc. ETH in 2012. The topic of his thesis is related to low-level binary translation and security. He analyzed different exploit techniques and wondered how we can enforce integrity for a subset of data (e.g., code pointers). All prototype implementations are open-source. In 2014, he started the 	b01lers Purdue CTF team 	. Some of his random ramblings on security-related topics are published on a 	security blog 	. You can find his publications under 	Publications or on 	Google scholar 	. His Curriculum Vitae 	is available as well.
