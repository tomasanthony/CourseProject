Welcome to Bob Wilson's Home Page I am a retired Senior Lecturer in the UMB Computer Science Department. I earned my BSEE and Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. My graduate work was funded by a National Science Foundation Fellowship. For over 12 years, I taught the "Introduction to Computing in Java" , "Data Structures" , "C Programming" , and "Computer Architecture and Organization" courses. For service to the CS department, I was the Undergraduate Program Director, CSM Senate Representative, and on various department committees. I may be teaching part-time in the future. If so, my semester schedule will be shown below. Prior to starting at UMB in 2002, I had retired early from a 30+ year career in industry. As a software engineer and a software development manager, I worked for the USAF, Honeywell, The Codex Corporation, and Motorola. My experience is predominantly in developing and testing embedded systems, network products, and communication protocol software. While working in industry, I was also teaching part-time for the Northeastern University State-of-the-Art Engineering Program in Dedham and Burlington.
