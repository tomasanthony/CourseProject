 Walter S. Lasecki Walter S. Lasecki Home Lab Publications About Curriculum Vitae (CV) | Short Bio Assistant Professor, University of Michigan Director, CROMA Lab Computer Science & Engineering, EECS (primary) School of Information Email: wlasecki@umich.edu Office: 2636 Beyster Course: User Interface Development (EECS 493) - Syllabus Link About Me I create systems that use both human and machine computation to solve problems quickly and reliably. I have helped introduce the idea of continuous real-time crowdsourcing, as well as the crowd agent model, which uses computer-mediated groups of people submitting input simultaneously to create a collective intelligence capable of completing tasks better than any constituent member.
