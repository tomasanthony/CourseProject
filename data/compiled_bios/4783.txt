 Nicola Dell Assistant Professor Information and Computer Science Cornell Tech 2 West Loop Road New York, NY, 10044 nixdell (at) cornell.edu About Publications Projects Students Teaching CV I am an Assistant Professor at Cornell University based at the Cornell Tech campus in New York City. I am also a part of the Jacobs Technion Cornell Institute . I advise students in the departments of Information Science and Computer Science . At Cornell, I am a member of the Center for Health Equity , the Digital Life Initiative , the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future , and I co-lead a research team studying computer security and privacy issues in the context of intimate partner violence. My research interests are in human-computer interaction (HCI) and information and communication technologiesand development (ICTD). My main focus is on designing, building, and evaluating novel computing systems that improve the lives of underserved populations in the US and around the world. I am broadly interested in understanding the social, technical, and infrastructural challenges faced by diverse populations and creating new technologies to address their uniquely-situated needs. To do this, I partner with numerous NGOs and government ministries to design and deploy novel computing systems that aim to have a positive impact in the world. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. At UW CSE I was a member of the Open Data Kit (ODK) research team. From 2011-2015 I also ran the Change Seminar , a group at the University of Washington exploring how technology can aidunderserved populations in low-income regions. Myresearch is generously supported by funding from the NSF, Google, Facebook, and others.
