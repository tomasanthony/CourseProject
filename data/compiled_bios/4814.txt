My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in genomics and personalized medicine . Some of my projects/interests include: Machine reading systems for scientific literature that help make biomedical knowledge easily accessible to scientists and clinicians ISMB17 Github New genome sequencing technologies that combine existing wetlab techniques with new statistical methods, thus making them significantly more affordable and accurate Nat. Biotech. 14 Nat. Biotech. 15 I also work on core machine learning problems such as: Uncertainty estimation techniques, particularly in the context of structured prediction and adversarial online learning NIPS15 AAAI17 Fast approximate inference in probabilistic models, including recent methods based on deep learning ICLR16 I am currently a post-doc with Stefano Ermon . I just defended my PhD from Stanford, where I worked with Serafim Batzoglou , Michael Snyder , Christopher Re , and Percy Liang . In 2012-2013, I spent a year off at Moleculo , where I developed algorithms that now power Illumina's genome phasing service.
