Phillip Rogaway I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, USA. I have also been a visiting professor at a bunch of places, including Chiang Mai University (TH), Chulalongkorn University (TH), ENS Paris (FR), ETH Zrich (CH), and The Isaac Newton Institute (UK). My research is in cryptography. After finishing an undergrad degree from UCB, I did my Ph.D. at MITs Theory of Computation group (1991), graduating under Silvio Micali. After that I worked at IBM as a security architect, then came to UCD (1994), where Ive spent most of the last 24 years. My research has focused on obtaining provably-good solutions to protocol problems of genuine utility. Ive been lucky enough to get some nice recognition: Levchin prize (2016), IACR Fellow (2012), ACM Paris Kanellakis Award (2009). These days, my technical work in cryptography is paired with corresponding concerns for social and ethical issues connected to technology, especially the problem of mass surveillance. Ive been working on a small book on that topic.

I am especially concerned, these days, with the environmental crisis we have created. Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous sums of money, one child recently explained.
