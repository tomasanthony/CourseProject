 Konstantinos Mamouras Research | Teaching | Publications | Other Konstantinos Mamouras mamouras [at] rice [dot] edu Department of Computer Science Rice University Office 3081, Duncan Hall Houston, TX 77006, USA I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science of Rice University. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania advised by Rajeev Alur . I received my Ph.D from the Computer Science department of Cornell University, where I was advised by Dexter Kozen . Research Interests I am currently working on the design of programming abstractions for processing data streams. Several real-time decision making applications rely on the computation of quantitative summaries of very large streams of data. We have proposed StreamQRE , a declarative query language that combines regular expressions, quantitative aggregation, and relational features. A compilation algorithm translates the high-level query into a streaming algorithm with precise guarantees for resource usage. I am also interested in program semantics and logics for program verification. In particular, this includes equational theories of programs based on the framework of Kleene Algebra with Tests.
