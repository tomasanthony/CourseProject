Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science University of California, Davis Curriculum Vitae: PDF E-mail: crubio AT ucdavis DOT edu Prospective students: I am looking for highly-motivated Ph.D. students to work on programming languages research problems. If interested, please apply to UC Davis here and include my name in your graduate admission application (you can also send me an e-mail, please include your CV). Dr. Rubio is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. Prior to that position, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where she worked with Koushik Sen, James Demmel, Costin Iancu, and William Kahan. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of WisconsinMadison in 2012, advised by Prof. Ben Liblit. Her work spans the areas of programming languages and software engineering, with a specific focus on program analysis. Her research aims to design and build tools to help developers write more reliable and efficient software. For her doctoral dissertation, she designed and applied static program analyses to find error-propagation bugs in large software systems. At UC Berkeley, Dr. Rubio led the development of dynamic program analysis tools to improve the performance of numerical programs. Dr. Rubio is a UC Davis CAMPOS Faculty Scholar, an AAUW International Doctoral Fellow, and a member of Latinas in Computing. Cindy earned her M.S. in Computer Science from the University of WisconsinMilwaukee and her B.S. in Computer Engineering from Saltillo Institute of Technology (Mexico). She also received a B.M. in Piano Performance from the Autonomous University of Coahuila (Mexico). Cindy is originally from Saltillo, Coahuila, Mxico.
