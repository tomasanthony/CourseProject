(PhD admission deadline: December every year) Please put down "Ka-Chun Wong" as your potential supervisor in your applications; otherwise, your applications may not reach us. More than 2000 USD will be provided to each PhD student in Hong Kong every month. PostDoc applicants are also encouraged to apply for Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme which will give at least 3000 USD per month for at least 3 years. Biography Ka-Chun was born and raised in Hong Kong where he was lucky enough to be immersed in a multi-cultural environment. He received his B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from United College , the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2008. He has also obtained his M.Phil. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the same university in 2010. From 2011 to 2014, he has spent 3.5 years to finish his PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto . With exposures to different aspects (academic, industrial, spiritual ,and social), he hopes to strike a balance and contribute to the society. News : Right after his PhD study, Ka-Chun has started his research lab as Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science , City University of Hong Kong ( 4th in QS World University Ranking aged under 50 and 14th in Times University Ranking aged under 50 ) in 2015. Interested applicants can contact him via email. Especially, PhD applicants are highly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (USD$ 3200 per month (tax free) ). The scheme is real merit-based and does not have any preference toward nationality, which reflects the open humanity and freedom of Hong Kong. Here are some facts about Hong Kong: Average IQ: 108, according to Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen . Human Deveopment Index (HDI) is 0.910 according to the United Nations in 2015. Students are consistently ranked among the top 3 with Finland and Shanghai according to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2012 . The official language of teaching in universities is English, while Cantonese and British English are commonly used outside schools. It is pretty sure that students will find their studies challenging and enjoyable there.
