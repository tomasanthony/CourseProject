 Bimal Viswanath Toggle navigation Latest updates Students Publications Teaching News Coverage Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Virginia Tech Google Scholar, CV Contact Email: vbimal at cs dot vt dot edu GPG Public Key 2202 Kraft Drive Knowledge Works II, RM 2216 Blacksburg, VA 24060 Phone: 540-231-8702 My research interests broadly cover security and privacy aspects of large online services. I am particularly interested in the emerging space at the intersection of machine learning and security . Three research directions include: (1) Attacks using ML: Investigating how recent developments in ML can be misused to abuse online services. (2) Attacks on ML systems: Understanding vulnerabilities of ML systems (e.g., Face recognition) and improving robustness. (3) ML for better security/privacy: Leveraging advances in ML to build better defenses against attacks on online services. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems where I was advised by Prof. Krishna P. Gummadi and Prof. Alan Mislove . Before joining VT, I spent ~2 years as a Postdoc as a member of SAND lab (at UCSB and UChicago ) working with Prof. Ben Y. Zhao . Prior to that, I spent a year as a Researcher at Nokia Bell Labs, Stuttgart . I am looking for students to work on research projects. Email me if you are interested! Latest Updates October 2018: I'll be teaching CS5984 Security Analytics in Spring 2019. Course summary is here . August 2018: I'll be teaching CS4254 Network Architecture and Programming in Fall 2018. Course details are up on canvas.
