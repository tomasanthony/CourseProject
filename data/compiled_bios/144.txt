 University of Washington College of Engineering A Community of Innovators Home People Research Papers EE Home Wind Integration Research Lab (WIRL) Our Research: Renewable Energy is an increasingly important topic on both the national and international stage. Wind energy is a fast growing renewable source and is second only to hydro in terms of renewable energy capacity. There are many technical challenges associated with high levels of wind penetration in a power system, and, as wind energy grows, the need for solutions to these challenges is more pressing. Our group seeks to address the challenge of wind variability and unpredictability on the time scale of hours to days ahead. Our goal is to quantify how wind variability and unpredictability effect different types of conventional generation by running unit commitment simulations.
