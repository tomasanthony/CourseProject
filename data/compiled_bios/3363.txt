My research areas span human-computer interaction and information retrieval, across the domains of mobile devices, self-tracking, games, and web search. My work involves decoding users' behavioral data to drive novel applications. My Ph.D. is in Information Science from the University of Washington in Seattle, and my masters and undergraduate degrees are in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before joining Brown, I analyzed search behavior at Microsoft Research, Google, Yahoo, and Bing. I was a Facebook Fellow and received a Google Research Award. I co-founded World Blender, a Techstars-backed company that makes geolocation mobile games. My research group is currently funded by NSF and NIH, including the NSF CAREER award. Brown University students interested in doing research work with me should review my HCI group's active projects and read this page about the research experience and expectations . Contact me with some information about your interests. You can find me on the popular social networking platform called email. Recent News May 2018 Farewell and congratulations to Sachin Pendse and Lucy van Kleunen who have been accepted to Ph.D. programs at Georgia Tech and the University of Colorado respectively. Jun 2017 I'll be serving as a Program Chair for the CHIIR 2018 conference in New Jersey, and the HCI Track Chair for SIGIR 2018 in Ann Arbor.
