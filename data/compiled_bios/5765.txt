But even after all this time, I continue to be amazed at all the new and different ways people put computing to use.After fifteen years in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech and eleven more years in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, I have joined the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. If you're a student in ECS 10 at UC Davis, you can find the information you're looking for above...just click to see either thehexapawn assignment description or the relevant PowerPoint slides. * Outside the world of computing, that first love was Cheryl Lambert from my kindergarten class.
