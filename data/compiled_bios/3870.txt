 I am a full professor in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington . I teach databases and do research in data management. I apply formal theory to novel and difficult data management tasks. My past work has addressed various aspects of managing semistructured data, including query languages, compression, query processing and type inference. My current work is on managing uncertain and probabilistic data, data privacy and security, the complexity of parallel query evaluation, and the theory of pricing data on the Web. My Erdos number is 2. A short bio is here .
