The main address from the ICICS/CS building is 2366 Main Mall. If you enter from this address, follow the signs to the X-wing, then take the south elevator to the 6th floor. My office is X665. The most direct way to get to my office is to enter the X-wing from street level (X-wing is it's own building, connected by walkways to the old building). The entrance is at the corner of Engineering Road and Agronomy Road, then take the south elevator to the 6th floor. My office is X665.
