I no longer update this webpage. Please visit this webpage instead. Biography I am an Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar at McGill Universitys School of Computer Science. Prior to joining McGill, I was a postdoc with Christos Papadimitriou at UC Berkeley. Before that, I finished my Ph.D. in the Theory of Computation group, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT under the supervision of Costis Daskalakis . I did my undergraduate study in the EECS department at Peking University.
