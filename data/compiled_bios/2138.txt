 B. Aditya Prakash Assistant Professor Computer Science Department Virginia Tech. About Me I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. I am also a member of the Discovery Analytics Center (DAC) at VT. Short third-person bio can be found here . Follow @badityap Education Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science: Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA 2007-2012 B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering: Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay, India 2003-2007 Schooling (Class I to XII): Delhi Public School - Bhilai, India 1990-2003 Research Interests If you are interested in joining the group: Thank you for your interest. Please see this first. How do opinions get formed in online forums? Which people should we immunize, to prevent an epidemic as fast as possible? I am broadly interested in Data Mining , Applied Machine Learning and Databases with emphasis on solving big-data problems in networks and time-series . Some of the research questions I answer deal with understanding and managing efficiently, dynamical mechanisms (like propagation) on networks, occurring across natural, social and technological systems. My research combines theoretical analysis of models, developing efficient algorithms and empirical studies on tera-byte scale data. I have also interests in time-series modeling and mining, and have worked perviously in privacy and anomaly detection. My advisor at CMU was Prof. Christos Faloutsos . Earlier at IIT Bombay, my advisor was Prof. S. Sudarshan where I worked on Query Optimization. Apart from Computer Science, I like Physics and World History. Here is my Resume : PDF .
