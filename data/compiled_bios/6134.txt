Mustafa Cenk Gursoy Professor Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 3-181 CST 315.443.4403 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D. , Princeton University, 2004. B.S., Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, 1999. Research Interests: Wireless communications Information theory Signal processing Cognitive radio systems Energy efficiency Quality of service provisioning in wireless systems Wireless information-Theoretic security Current Research: Our recent research concentrated on the energy efficiency in wireless systems, performance analysis in wireless multiuser networks operating under quality of service (QoS) constraints, and energy-security tradeoffs in multi-antenna wireless communications. We are also currently exploring cooperative and cognitive operation in wireless systems and the impact of interference. In particular, we study the spectrum and energy efficiency in cooperative relay channels, conduct performance analysis in cognitive radio channels in the presence of channel and/or sensing uncertainty, and investigate the throughput in fading interference channels under queuing constraints.
