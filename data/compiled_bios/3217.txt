GRASShopper A verification tool that checks functional correctness of programs manipulating heap-allocated data structures. Vermeer An automated debugging tool that traces and explains faults in C programs. Picasso A static analyzer for depth-bounded concurrent systems. It has been used to verify properties of non-blocking concurrent data structures and distributed message passing algorithms with an unbounded number of threads and messages. Jahob A verification system for programs written in a subset of Java. Using Jahob, developers can statically prove that methods satisfy their contracts in all possible executions, as well as that they preserve essential structural invariants and design constraints. Bohne A symbolic shape analysis tool. It infers loop invariants of programs manipulating heap-allocated data structures. Bohne is integrated into the Jahob verification system. SLAyer A tool for automatic formal verification of industrial low-level software components. SLAyer is being developed at Microsoft Research Cambridge . HAVOC A tool for specifying and checking properties of systems software written in C, in the presence of pointer manipulations, unsafe casts and dynamic memory allocation. HAVOC is being developed at Microsoft Research Redmond .
