James Cohoon Associate Professor, Computer Science Bio B.S. Ramapo College of New Jersey, 1976M.S. Pennsylvania State University, 1978Ph.D. University of Minnesota, 1982 "My algorithms help optimize the physical design of everyday digital devices. My educational research enables CS classrooms to be effective to all." James Cohoon, Associate Professor Jim Cohoon received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and is an Associate Professor at the University of Virginia. He is an Associate Chair for its Department of Computer Science and Director of its undergraduate BS program. He is a former Fulbright Scholar and winner of the IEEE Computer Science Taylor L. Booth Education Award. He has been a member of ACM Council and the ACM SIG Governing Board Executive Committee, and is a past chair of the ACM SIG for Design Automation. Jim Cohoon has co-authored several programming language textbooks. His research interests are swarm algorithms and models, probabilistic search, routing, and Computer Science education and broadening participation. He and his students produce state-of-the-art tools that are practical as well as theoretically interesting. In Computer Science education Jim Cohoon is a proponent of continuous active learning, continuous active student recruiting, and regular outreach.
