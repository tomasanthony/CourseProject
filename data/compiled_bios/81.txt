He is the Director of the Center for Programmable Extreme Scale Computing, and past Director of the Illinois-Intel Parallelism Center (I2PC) . He is a Fellow of IEEE (2004), ACM (2010), and AAAS (2016). He received the IEEE Computer Society 2015 Technical Achievement Award, for "Pioneering contributions to shared-memory multiprocessor architectures and thread-level speculation", and the 2017 UIUC Campus Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Mentoring. He is a member of the Computing Research Association (CRA) Board of Directors. He has served as the Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Architecture (TCCA) (2005-2010) and as a Council Member of CRAs Computing Community Consortium (CCC) (2011-2014). He was a Willett Faculty Scholar at UIUC (2002-2009). As of 2016, he has graduated 36 Ph.D. students, who are now leaders in academia and industry. He received a Ph.D. from Stanford University. Biography of Josep Torrellas. Publications Curr. Vitae Students Graduated Torrellas leads The i-acoma Architecture Group , which focuses on new processor, memory, and system technologies and organizations to build novel multiprocessor computer architectures. The two main projects are: A novel multicore architecture for programmability: The Bulk Multicore Architecture (Communications of the ACM, December 2009). [Presentation slides]. EE Times article that discusses the Bulk Multicore. Dr. Dobb's Journal discussion of the Bulk Multicore. Making Parallel Programming Easy: Research Contributions from Illinois, a book summarizing the accomplishments of the Illinois-Intel Parallelism Center (I2PC). This project is funded under the Illinois Intel Parallelism Center (I2PC). An extreme-scale multiprocessor architecture designed from the ground up for energy and power efficiency: Thrifty: An Extreme-Scale Multiprocessor Architecture (IEEE Computer, November 2009). [Presentation slides]. Extreme-Scale Computer Architecture: Energy Efficiency from the Ground Up (DATE, March 2014). This work is part of an Intel-lead DARPA project that aims to design an Extreme-Scale computer. Intel blog on the DARPA project. This project is funded by DARPA under UHPC and DOE. Recent Designed Architectures: "QuickRec: A Hardware Prototype for Recording and Deterministically Replaying Multithreaded Programs in the Intel Architecture" . This prototype has been developed in collaboration with Intel, and is described in the QuickRec ISCA-2013 paper. "Runnemede: An Chip Multiprocessor for Extreme-Scale Computing" . This manycore chip has been designed in collaboration with Intel, and is described in the Runnemede HPCA-2013 paper.
