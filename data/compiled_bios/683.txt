But when you do reach the top of the mountain, you see the valley below; and that gives you a sense of contentment. --- Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Trustworthy Quantum Information Some of my favorate open problems on device-independent quantum cryptography. This is a presentation at the AQIS 2016. Quantum Technology: Challenges and Opportunities for Cyber Security This is a presentation at the 2015 North American International Cyber Summit. Quantum Information Technology is becoming real. The implication for information security is far-reaching. A crisis is looming as the very foundation of cryptography is being challenged. Much of todays public key cryptography will be defeated by large scale quantum computers. If a secret needs to stay secret for many years to come, encrypting it using current technologies is inadequate. To overcome these challenges, Post-Quantum Cryptography has emerged as an active area of research for searching for alternatives that are quantum resilient and at the same time practical. While threatening todays cryptography, quantum information on the other hand enables unbreakable quantum cryptography. Most remarkably, some quantum cryptographic methods are trustworthy, i.e., the hardware will prove its integrity to the user. This is in contrast to the current solutions, which are trusted, i.e., require the users faith on their integrity. In this talk, I will outline these challenges and opportunities without assuming any prior knowledge of the field. Trustworthy Quantum Information Workshop, June 28 - July 2, 2015, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA This was an international workshop that I co-organized with Roger Colbeck (York), Xiongfeng Ma (Tsinghua), and Stefano Pirandola (York). The Second Workshop will be in Shanghai. Randomness: Between Faith and Reality Randomness is a faith: it is impossible to test directly. In fact, we can't even know for sure its existence. Yet randomness is also indispensable in reality: it is the mother secret that gives life to the security of modern cryptography. When blind faith is not virtuous, how much of it is necessary for ensuring true randomness? In this general-audience talk at the Randomness in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond conference, I argued that it is not too much.

E-mail: Research Interests: Quantum Information Science. I have worked on several topics in theoretical quantum information science: query complexity, computational complexity, communication complexity, universality, classical simulations, quantum channels, and quantum cryptography. My current projects include quantum cryptography (see my tutorial talk "Untrusted Quantum Devices"), quantum algorithms, and quantum error-correction. I am also interested in learning and exploring "post-quantum" cryptography, or classical cryptography secure against a quantum adversary. Most, if not all, widely used public key cryptography systems (such as RSA) are not secure under quantum attack. Thus as quantum computing becomes a reality, the subject of post-quantum cryptography will be more and more important.
