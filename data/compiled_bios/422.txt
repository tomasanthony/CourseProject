CHAM, Tat Jen BA PhD Cambridge Associate Professor School of Computer Science & Engineering Nanyang Technological University Singapore Biographical Sketch Tat-Jen is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science & Engineering, Nanyang Technological University. He received his BA in Engineering in 1993 and his PhD in 1996, both from the University of Cambridge. Tat-Jen was subsequently conferred a Jesus College Research Fellowship in Science in 1996-97. From 1998 to 2001, he was a research scientist at DEC/Compaq Research Lab in Cambridge, MA, USA. After joining NTU in 2002, he was concurrently a Faculty Fellow in the Singapore-MIT Alliance Computer Science Program in 2003-2006. In research., Tat-Jen received overall best paper prizes at PROCAMS05, BMVC94, and in particular at ECCV'96, while his PhD student Minh-Tri Pham was awarded the PREMIA 2nd best student paper prize for their ICCV'2007 paper. Tat-Jen is an inventor on eight patents. He is currently a co-Principal Investigator in the NRF BeingTogether Centre (BTC) on 3D Telepresence, a collaboration between NTU and UNC at Chapel Hill. Tat-Jen is on the editorial board for the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV). He has been a General Chair for ACCV14, Area Chair for ICCV'09, ACCV07, ICCV05 and ACCV06, Associate Editor for IJIG and IPSJ-CVA, a Program Chair for MMM07, and a co-founder for the PROCAMS workshop series in 2003. Nationally, he has been on various review panels for A*STAR and the National Research Foundation (NRF). Tat-Jen has served for a number of terms on the NTU Senate, and previous roles held include being the Director for the Centre for Multimedia & Network Technology (CeMNet) and an affiliate faculty with the Singapore-ETH Centres Future Cities Lab. Tat-Jens research interests are broadly in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, his BTC team has focused on high-fidelity 3D dynamic reconstruction of humans and room environments with casually placed sensors, via deep learning approaches for semantic understanding to enable accurate reconstruction in the presence of clutter, occlusion and limited sensor coverage. His previous work includes image-based localization in urban environments, object matching and registration, human tracking, activity recognition, as well as projector-camera systems to turn all surfaces into ubiquitous interactive displays.
