 Chris Umans [ Home ][ Research ][ Teaching ][ Theory links ][ Other ] I am a professor of Computer Science in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at Caltech , and a member of the Theory Group . My research interests are in theoretical computer science, especially computational complexity. Specifically, I am interested in derandomization, explicit constructions, algebraic complexity and algorithms, and hardness of approximation. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Berkeley in 2000. From 2000-2002 I was a postdoc in the Theory Group at Microsoft Research . I joined Caltech in 2002. Apply to Caltech: graduate studies (indicate "theory" as area of interest) postdoc positions (through CMI ) faculty positions Some professional activities: Some recent program committees: FOCS 2017 (chair) accepted papers ITCS 2017 , RANDOM 2016 (chair), STOC 2015, STOC 2014, CCC 2013 (chair), FOCS 2011, RANDOM 2010, CCC 2009, STOC 2009, FOCS 2007 Member of the Committee for the Advancement of Theoretical Computer Science (CATCS). Member of the scientific board of ECCC . Managing editor of Theory of Computing (ToC). Editorial boards of ACM Transactions on Computation Theory (TOCT), Computational Complexity (CC), Algorithmica (ALGO), and Journal of Computer and System Sciences (JCSS).
