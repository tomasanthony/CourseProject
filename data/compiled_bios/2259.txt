ETNews on 3D CAPTCHAs, 2016 ( Korean Article Click Here ) Aug. 2016. Our paper "3D CAPTCHAs" was selected as the best paper at WISA 2016 About Me I'm Simon Woo. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Univ. of Southern California(USC), Los Angeles, M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from University of Washington (UW), Seattle. I was a member of technical staff (technologist) for 9 years at the NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Pasadena, CA, conducting research in satellite communications, networking and cybersecurity areas. Also, I worked at Intel Corp. and Verisign Research Lab. Research Interest My most recent research focuses on the interdisciplinary research, usable security, to better understand human behaviors/factors and improve security and privacy in computer systems. My other research interests include cybersecurity education, security and privacy in IoT & cloud systems, domain name system (DNS), online social networks, and satellite communications. In particular, I am interested in applying theories from psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, and social science as well as the latest techniques from natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and computer vision to better design and address security and privacy issues.
