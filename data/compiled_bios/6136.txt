Can Isik Interim Dean Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 131 Link Hall 315.443.3604 [email&#160;protected] Personal Website &#9656; Degree(s): Ph.D. University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 1985. M.S. Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, 1980. B.S. Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, 1978. Lab/Center Affiliation(s): Syracuse Center of Excellence CASE Center Research Interests: Intelligent systems applications Indoor environment control Modeling and forecasting for financial systems Medical Instrumentation Current Research: Modeling complex systems for improved control, forecasting, and signal processing is at the heart of my current research. I use a combination of analytical and computational methods, such as neural nets, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, validated by experimental and simulated data. We have applied this approach to process control, indoor environmental control, medical instrumentation, diagnostics and prognostics, and computational finance.
