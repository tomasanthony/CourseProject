My research covers a range of topics in Security and Privacy, Internet Measurement, Mobile Networks, and HCI, mostly from data-driven perspectives. My current projects are focused on the security and privacy of mobile and IoT systems, security of social computing systems, spear phishing, adversarial machine learning, and machine learning explanation. My work targets top conferences such as Usenix Security/CCS/NDSS/Oakland, WWW/IMC, and CHI/CSCW. At Virginia Tech, I am affiliated with the Center for Computer Systems and the Center for Human-Computer Interaction (CHCI) . I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), ACM CCS Outstanding Paper Award (2018), and SIGMETRICS Best Practical Paper Award (2013) I obtained my PhD from UC Santa Barbara under the supervision of Ben Y. Zhao and Heather Zheng in 2016. I received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2010. I spent two summers at Microsoft Research Redmond in 2011 and 2014. Looking for bright students I have many cool projects, and I am looking for bright and passionate students to drive them! Email me if you're interested in working with me.
