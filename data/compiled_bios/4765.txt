My research group is part of the Computer Systems Laboratory, and we broadly work on energy-efficient parallel computer architecture for both high-performance and embedded applications. I am also interested in parallel programming methodologies, hardware specialization, interconnection networks, VLSI chip-design methodologies, and the intersection between computer architecture and future emerging technologies. Building prototype systems is an integral part of my research, as this is one of the best ways to validate assumptions, gain intuition about physical design issues, and provide platforms for future software research. My research has been recognized with several awards including a Cornell Engineering Research Excellence Award (2015), an AFOSR Young Investigator Program award (2015), an Intel Early Career Faculty Honor Program award (2013), an NSF CAREER award (2012), a DARPA Young Faculty Award (2012), and an IEEE Micro Top Picks selection (2004). My teaching has been recognized with the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Excellence in Teaching (2016), two Michael Tien '72 Excellence in Teaching Awards (2013,2017), and a James M. and Marsha D. McCormick Award for Outstanding Advising of First-Year Engineering Students (2013). In 2018, I was a Visiting Scholar at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK and a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall also in Cambridge, UK. Prior to joining Cornell University, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 2007 to 2009, I was a visiting scholar in the Parallel Computing Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley; I received an M.Phil. in Engineering as a Churchill Scholar at the University of Cambridge in 2000, and received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering as a Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia in 1999.

The chip includes four RISC-V RV32IMAF cores which share a 32KB instruction cache, 32KB data cache, and single-precision floating point unit along with microarchitectural mechanisms to mitigate the performance impact of resource sharing. The chip also includes a fully synthesizable high-performance PLL originally designed for the DARPA CRAFT project by Ian Galton and Julian Puscar from UC San Diego. Project was led by Christopher Torng with contributions from Shunning Jiang (core RTL design, verification), Khalid Al-Hawaj (cache RTL design, verification), Ivan Bukreyev (PLL porting), Berkin Ilbeyi (Bloom filter and FPU design), Tuan Ta (CL simulation, arbiter RTL design), and Lin Cheng (microbenchmark development).
