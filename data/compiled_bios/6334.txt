Smith received the B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Physics in 1958 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Physics in 1961 and 1964, all from McGill University, Montreal, P.Q., Canada. From 1958 to 1959 he was an Engineer at the Canadian Marconi Company, Montreal, Canada, where he worked on transistor circuitry. After obtaining his Ph.D. degree, he joined Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, NJ, USA, where he conducted research on laser mode selection and mode-locking, pioneered the development of waveguide gas lasers, and demonstrated and developed hybrid bistable optical devices. In 1970, he spent nine months at the University of California, Berkeley as Visiting Mackay Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and in 1978-1979 he was a visiting research scientist at the Laboratoire dOptique Quantique, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France. From 1984 to 1992 he was with Bell Communications Research, Red Bank, NJ, USA, where for the last three years he was Division Manager of Photonic Science and Technology Research. In July 1992 he became Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the University of Toronto. From 1992 to 1995 he served as Executive Director of the Ontario Laser and Lightwave Research Centre, and from 1999 to 2003 as Director of the Nortel Institute for Telecommunications at the University of Toronto. Since 2003 he has been Professor Emeritus, and has pursued research interests in photonics involving fibre Bragg grating devices, ultrafast optical switching, and nonlinear optical properties of nanocrystals. He has published over 300 technical papers in refereed journals and conference proceedings (with over 7,500 citations listed in the ISI Science Citations Index), and holds 34 patents in the photonics area.; The Edward S.
