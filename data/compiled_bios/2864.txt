Bernard Wong	Bernard Wong	Associate Professor	Davis Center Room 3514	David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science	University of Waterloo	200 University Ave. West	Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada	E-mail: bernard AT uwaterloo DOT ca	Phone: (519) 888-4567 x31301	My research interests span distributed systems and networking,	with particular emphasis on problems involving decentralized	services, self-organizing networks, and distributed storage	systems.	Prospective students: I am currently seeking	motivated graduate students who enjoy building large systems. More information	about the School's graduate program requirements can be found	here.	Teaching	Fall 2016	CS 854 Consensus Protocols	Winter 2016	CS 350 Operating Systems	Fall 2015	CS 350 Operating Systems	Winter 2015	CS 854 Cloud Computing and Software-Defined Networking	Fall 2014	CS 350 Operating Systems	Spring 2014	CS 854 Cloud Computing and Software-Defined Networking	Fall and Winter 2013	CS 343 Concurrent and Parallel Programming	Fall 2012	CS 854 Cloud Computing & Management	This is a graduate course on current research topics in	cloud computing and management. It is offered as a	"paper-chase" course: we read and discuss	important papers on different subtopics in cloud computing and	management each week. Students must also individually complete	a final project that explores a new idea in one of the	sub-topics covered in the course. The goal is that by the end	of the course, the final project can serve as a starting point	for a workshop paper submission.
