 Prorok Lab Home Team Publications Media Principal Investigator Amanda Prorok is anAssistant Professor (University Lecturer) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, at Cambridge University , and a Fellow of Pembroke College . Her research lab designs algorithms for coordinating systems composed of multiple autonomous robots. The lab's mission is to facilitate cooperation in large-scale, heterogeneous, multi-agent cyber-physical systems. This research brings in methods from planning, control, estimation, and learning, and has numerous applications, including automated transport and logistics, environmental monitoring, surveillance, and search. Amanda Prorok has been honored by the EPSRC New Investigator Award, the Isaac Newton Trust Early Career Award, and the Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) Award for the best thesis at EPFL in Computer Science. Further awards include Best Paper at DARS 2018, Finalist for Best Multi-Robot Systems Paper at ICRA 2017, Best Paper at BICT 2015, and MIT Rising Stars 2015. She serves as Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (R-AL), and Associate Editor for Autonomous Robots (AURO). Prior to joining Cambridge, Amanda Prorok was a postdoctoral researcher at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception ( GRASP ) Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, USA, where she worked with Prof. Vijay Kumar . She completed her PhD at EPFL , Switzerland, under the direction of Prof. Alcherio Martinoli .
